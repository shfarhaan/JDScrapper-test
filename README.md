This is a possible readme file for the JDScrapper-test repository:

# JDScrapper-test
This repository contains a Python script that scrapes job descriptions from Indeed.com using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The script takes a job title and a location as input and returns a CSV file with the job title, company name, location, salary, summary, and URL of each job listing.
