Is H&M right for me?

People who are happy and do well at H&M tend to thrive on using their intuition and common sense. We might be the place of possibility, but we’re also a place of ambiguity and constant change. This is not a company for micro-managers or people who operate on autopilot. This is a company where your opinions will inform business decisions, so you need to enjoy making them heard, questioning how things work, and trying things that you might not be familiar with.

Consequently, we depend on teamwork. And we have a pretty high tolerance for failure, provided you can show you’re learning. You can expect to take on new responsibilities and to move around a bit, too, so this could be the start of a varied and rewarding career if that’s what you’re looking for.

Thinking about applying?

If all of this sounds like it might be your kind of thing then you should definitely apply by 18 October 2023. If your CV is selected then a recruiter will invite you for a phone / video call, followed by a couple of interviews.

"National Consultant for Gender, DRR and Humanitarian Action - Dhaka","UN Women · Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh  1 day ago  · 64 applicants","About the job
Background

Background

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security. Placing women’s rights at the centre of all its efforts, UN Women leads and coordinates United Nations system efforts to ensure that commitments on gender equality and gender mainstreaming translate into action throughout the world. UN Women provides strong and coherent leadership in support of Member States’ priorities and efforts, building effective partnerships with civil society and other relevant actors.

UN Women in Bangladesh supports the government to implement commitments to international normative standards on gender equality and women’s human rights. The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2022-2026 was launched in 2021 and the corresponding UN Women Bangladesh Strategy Note (2022-2026), defining UN Women’s strategic engagement in Bangladesh, has also been finalized. The country strategy focuses on strengthening the national structures and mechanisms for gender mainstreaming in policies, plans and budgets; supporting efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against women; promoting women’s access to decent and safe work; promoting policies and government investment in women’s empowerment and resilience building in the context of climate change, humanitarian crisis as well as other threats to peace and security.

UN Women works on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) supporting disaster and climate-vulnerable women from the most disaster-prone parts of the country and generating knowledge and evidence on how gender inequality drives vulnerability and marginalization and determine ways in which achieving gender equality can lead to a more resilient and empowered Bangladesh.

UN Women jointly with UNEP is implementing a regional programme “EmPower: Women for Climate-Resilient Societies” to strengthen gender equality in disaster risk reduction and climate change actions in Asia and the Pacific. The three year project (2023- 2025) aims for women and marginalized groups in three countries : Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam to become more resilient to the adverse impacts of climate change and disasters. The approach is to generate knowledge on gender and climate change, enhance capacities of relevant government entities at national and local level through producing tools, and capacity building training. The project also seeks to strengthen the leadership capacity of women led CSOs in locally led climate change adaptation.

UN Women co-chairs the Gender in Humanitarian Action (GiHA) Working Group with Department of Women Affairs, to ensure integration of gender equality into all humanitarian actions so that the needs of all affected populations – women, men, girls, boys, and gender diverse groups are addressed equally, their rights protected, and women’s leadership and decision-making promoted. The overall aim of the group is to support the realization of gender responsive programming by mainstreaming gender equality in the actions of each of the thematic clusters, inter-cluster working groups (WG) and the overall joint response and preparedness efforts throughout the humanitarian action phase (emergency response preparedness, assessment, analysis, strategic planning, resource mobilization, implementation, monitoring, review, and lesson learning).

Company Description

H&M Group 

The H&M Group is one of the biggest fashion companies in the world. When you begin a career with us, there’s no limit to where it can take you. Here, your customer focus and love for fashion, design and business is supported and encouraged, and your individual contribution can truly make a difference. We are a fair and equal employer with many unique brands all over the world, offering endless opportunities for you to explore your own path. Join our international team with fantastic people who have already discovered that this is the place to be.

About H&M Production

Transform design ideas into real products at H&M Production. The direct point of contact for local suppliers in over 20 sourcing markets, we ensure that top-quality products are made as sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.

Job Description

As Merchandiser you pretty much run our product offer. By managing and optimizing the entire workflow, you ensure that we secure the best deal for each home product. Now, ‘best deal’ might sound simple at face value. But there’s a bit more to it than that. In essence, it’s about striking the right balance between a few different things. 

Of course, you need to get the best price. For us, for the customer. But you also need to consider production lead-times, so that items are in store and online when they need to be. You need to factor in quality. Does the product have the right look and feel? Is it safe, user-friendly, or comfortable to wear? And always, these need to be considered with sustainability in mind. You are responsible to understand competitive environment and get the correct balance between the expectations of the customer and the objectives of the company's strategy. You are a point of contact with existing and new home textile suppliers, building and maintaining strong relationships with them. You monitor suppliers’ performance and manage supplier relations related to short and long-term goals of production by considering all success factors such as price, fashion, speed, sustainable material and innovation. 

You work in cooperation with Supply Chain, other brand/assortment groups to secure best production and to optimize procurement procedures. You feed the Supply Chain team with your customer group strategy in your country/region and give them the vision to build required capacity. During the business execution, you build cooperation with Supply Chain to align and secure optimized procurement procedures. But it’s not just about using data and product textile knowledge to develop creative solutions. It’s an intensively collaborative position, too. 

Qualifications

The person we are looking for must have experience in order follow-up & price negotiation. A team player, who can drive towards the common goal and should preferably have extensive knowledge in handling different hard goods products. Strong communication skills will also be a key element when deciding who we will hire for the role as you will need to build relationships across Production and Buying Office.  To be successful in this role, you need to have strong analytical skills for anticipating potential challenges on a global level, suggesting optimizations, and resolving issues. Most importantly, we are looking for someone who have strong ownership and can work independently. 

This role touches almost the entire supply chain, so you need to proactively manage various internal stakeholders globally, balancing different, sometimes competing—or even conflicting— priorities and somehow finding your way through it all to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. When it works, it’s a symphony of global level coordination. And when it doesn’t, you have contingent strategies in place to minimize the impact. 

Apart from these skills, you must also have: 

Academic background in Textile Engineering/ Business is preferrable. 
2-3 years of working experience (Preferably in buying office) with Home Textile & Hardgoods Product. 
Ability to multi-task and work under pressure. 
Committed, Flexible, Passionate, and inspirational team player 
Strong communication skill with internal & external stake holders. 


Additional Information

Is H&M right for me?

People who are happy and do well at H&M tend to thrive on using their intuition and common sense. We might be the place of possibility, but we’re also a place of ambiguity and constant change. This is not a company for micro-managers or people who operate on autopilot. This is a company where your opinions will inform business decisions, so you need to enjoy making them heard, questioning how things work, and trying things that you might not be familiar with.

Consequently, we depend on teamwork. And we have a pretty high tolerance for failure, provided you can show you’re learning. You can expect to take on new responsibilities and to move around a bit, too, so this could be the start of a varied and rewarding career if that’s what you’re looking for.

Thinking about applying?

If all of this sounds like it might be your kind of thing then you should definitely apply by 25 October 2023. If your CV is selected then a recruiter will invite you for a phone / video call, followed by a couple of interviews.

H&M is committed to creating a Diverse & Inclusive environment and we are actively looking for qualified candidates irrespective of race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability or age."

Jointly with the Market Systems Team Lead and MEL team, review existing grants, sub-awards, and partnerships in their portfolio; identify opportunities to adapt and learn, expand impact, design new intervention areas and/or increase sustainability.
Collaborate with other technical experts and ensure that GESI approaches are systematically integrated into all project interventions / result areas.
Serve as the main project liaison with national and sub-national public sector who are conducting nutrition and gender activities. 
Support the Food Systems and Social Behavior Change Program Managers in designing solutions that increase consumption of balanced, nutritious, diets; decrease malnutrition; and address obesity; through contextually relevant technical inputs in nutrition and dietetics.

Are you a customer support veteran who relies on deep technical experience and leadership skills?

Trilogy built a fully remote support system based on customer obsession, a world-class knowledge base, and highly skilled agents capable of servicing over 10,000 customers on over 100 products. We count on our support managers to dive deep into the details and make the improvements that help the system achieve its full potential, and we lean on AI to help our customers solve problems autonomously instead of waiting around for an agent to become available.

Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a customer support veteran who relies on deep technical experience and leadership skills? When a customer is unhappy, do you dig through individual support tickets and get knee-deep in granular details to discover the root cause of the problem? Do you try to stay ahead of the AI curve, using generative AI tools to help you write or debug code? If so, Trilogy's customer support team is the place for you!

Trilogy built a fully remote support system based on customer obsession, a world-class knowledge base, and highly skilled agents capable of servicing over 10,000 customers on over 100 products. We count on our support managers to dive deep into the details and make the improvements that help the system achieve its full potential, and we lean on AI to help our customers solve problems autonomously instead of waiting around for an agent to become available.

Our service is the #1 reason our customers continue to partner with us year after year, and our support leaders are responsible for making that service first-class. If you’re looking to take charge in a high-stakes environment, then we invite you to take the next big step in your career.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Specializing in specific products. From L1 agents all the way to the top, our organization provides stellar service to every customer on every product.
Deferring to gut feeling and managerial instinct. We are a knowledge-driven organization, and our managers make decisions based on hard evidence.

Director Technical Support Key Responsibilities

Ensuring the delivery of thousands of support tickets per week to tens of thousands of customers worldwide

Basic Requirements

At least 5 years of technical customer support experience

More than 200 model CSA villages will be developed in the ZOI districts with a village farm area group seeking advice on how to set up and operate an agriculture cooperative to serve area farmers with CSA input supply and sale of harvested crops by linking farmer-members to buyers. These 200 villages will be advertised as model villages and gradually spread all over the country. Farmers’ incomes will increase, bolstering food and nutrition security.

The Three Intermediate Results (IR) Of The Activity Are

IR 1: Increased availability of climate-resilient varieties of target crops through seed system strengthening.

IR 2: Enhanced market delivery of climate-adapted innovations of agro-inputs, including seeds, practices, and climate information services.
