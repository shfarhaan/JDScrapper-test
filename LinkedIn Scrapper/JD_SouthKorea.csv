Software Engineer - Python and K8s,"Canonical · Seoul, Seoul, South Korea  1 day ago  · 5 applicants","About the job
Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical. Our internal workloads are in many cases the same open source workloads that our customers want to operate. This team will productise those workloads for real-time automated operations on Kubernetes.

This role is ideal for software engineers who enjoy Python, have a passion for distributed systems, and an interest in the entire Linux stack - from kernel to networking to virtualization and containers. It is a role that requires rigour in both code and customer interactions. Our engineers are technically astute open source enthusiasts who are excited about cloud computing and are ready to join a global team charged with delivering world class services to our customers.

Strong Python development skills and familiarity with Kubernetes are key requirements of this role. You'll work closely with other teams in Canonical to ensure your products operate reliably, efficiently and scale to production sized workloads for our customers looking to adopt cutting-edge technology. You will participate and be responsible for ensuring sound software architecture and follow best practices in software quality, testing and documentation.

What you'll do

Work in Python to design and deliver open source software operations code
Work across the entire Linux stack, from kernel, networking, storage, to applications
Learn to think rigorously about application and infrastructure reliability
Shape high quality open source monitoring and alerting infrastructure
Simplify open source operations for our customers and open source community
Demonstrate sound engineering design and testing principles in your code
Follow agile software development practices
Coach and develop your colleagues where you have insights
Grow a healthy, collaborative engineering culture in line with company values
Work from home with global travel once or twice a year for up to 2 weeks for events

Who you are

You love technology and working with brilliant people
You have a Bachelor's or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree
You are experienced with Linux systems administration, package management, and operations
You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

Canonical is a growing international software company that works with the open-source community to deliver Ubuntu, ""the world's best free software platform"". Our mission is to realise the potential of free software in the lives of individuals and organisations. Our services are helping individuals and businesses worldwide to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance security with Ubuntu.

We are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity we will give your application fair consideration.

Quantitative Researcher,"WorldQuant · Seoul, Seoul, South Korea  3 months ago  · 93 applicants","About the job
WorldQuant develops and deploys systematic financial strategies across a broad range of asset classes and global markets. We seek to produce high-quality predictive signals (alphas) through our proprietary research platform to employ financial strategies focused on exploiting market inefficiencies. Our teams work collaboratively to drive the production of alphas and financial strategies – the foundation of a balanced, global investment platform.

WorldQuant’s success is built on a culture that pairs academic sensibility with accountability for results. Employees are encouraged to think openly about problems, balancing intellectualism and practicality. Excellent ideas come from anyone, anywhere. Employees are encouraged to challenge conventional thinking and possess an attitude of continuous improvement. That’s a key ingredient in remaining a leader in any industry.

Our goal is to hire the best and the brightest. We value intellectual horsepower first and foremost, and people who demonstrate an outstanding talent. There is no roadmap to future success, so we need people who can help us build it. Our collective intelligence will drive us there.

The Role: Research is at the core of WorldQuant. Through rigorous exploration and unconstrained thinking about how to apply data to the financial markets, our researchers are in constant search of new alphas. We strive to understand data in ways our competitors don’t believe is possible. Researchers at WorldQuant employ tested processes seeking to identify high-quality predictive signals that we believe are undiscovered by the wider market. These signals are mathematical expressions of data that are used as inputs in our quantitative models.

WorldQuant is seeking an exceptional individual to join the firm as a Quantitative Researcher. The person must have a strong understanding of the investment research process to create computer-based models that seek to predict movements of global financial markets. While prior finance experience is not required, a successful candidate must possess a strong interest in learning about finance and global markets. Candidates will have a research scientist mind-set; be a self-starter, a creative and persevering deep thinker who is motivated by unsolved challenges

What You’ll Bring

Ph.D., M.S., or B.S. degree from a leading university in a quantitative or highly analytical field (e.g. Industrial Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Financial Engineering, etc.)
Excellent academic record
Proficiency in C/C++ or Python or in other programming languages
Excellent problem solving abilities and judgment with a strong attention to detail
Mature, thoughtful, with the ability to operate in a collaborative, team-oriented culture
Able to communicate in English (written and verbal)


What We Offer

Understand the connections between advanced mathematical, computational and machine learning methods and their intersection with the modern financial industry
Highly competitive compensation
Learn from world-leading quantitative researchers
Friendly and collegial working environment
Opportunity to be promoted to Vice President in 2-4 years; followed by possible global mobility within the firm’s other locations (for the right role and right reasons)

우리 OVERDARE를 소개합니다.

우리는 Project Migaloo에서 OVERDARE로 재탄생 되었습니다.

이 이름은 '무모하고 대담하다'라는 뜻의 영단어인 OVERDARE로, 발음이 비슷한 '저기 어딘가(Over there)'라는 뜻도 가지고 있습니다.

우리는 기존에 없던 모바일 인터렉티브 UGC(사용자 제작 콘텐츠) 플랫폼을 만들기 위해 대담한 용기를 가지고 나아가는 것을 목표로 합니다.

OVERDARE는 액션 RPG, 스포츠 게임, 슈터 게임 등 다양한 게임을 제작할 수 있는 모바일 기반의 UGC 플랫폼입니다.

이용자들은 생성형 AI와 언리얼 5 엔진을 활용하여 양질의 콘텐츠를 손쉽게 제작할 수 있습니다.

뿐만 아니라 게임 제작 외에도 아바타 커스터마이징, 채팅 등 다양한 소셜 활동도 가능합니다.

또한, 메타버스 공간에서 콘텐츠 크리에이터가 다양한 저작물을 창작하면, 이용자들이 해당 저작물을 구매하고 소유하는 방식의 C2E(Create-to-Earn) 시스템을 도입하였습니다.

저작물 거래는 NFT와 블록체인을 기반으로 이루어지며, 모든 거래 내역은 블록체인에 기록되어 거래와 정산의 투명성과 신뢰성을 높였습니다.

OVERDARE는 2023년 12월에 소프트론칭되며, 내년 상반기를 목표로 글로벌 정식 출시될 예정입니다.

PUBG를 만든 크래프톤의 기술력과 제페토를 만든 네이버제트의 경험이 만나, 지금껏 경험하지 못했던 다채로운 즐거움이 가득한 새로운 플랫폼이 탄생할 거라 굳게 믿고 있습니다.

그리고 그 믿음을 더 빨리 현실화하기 위해서는 지금까지 각자의 영역에서 탄탄한 역량을 쌓아온 도전정신 가득한 여러분의 합류가 절실합니다.

우리 OVERDARE를 소개합니다.

우리는 Project Migaloo에서 OVERDARE로 재탄생 되었습니다.

이 이름은 '무모하고 대담하다'라는 뜻의 영단어인 OVERDARE로, 발음이 비슷한 '저기 어딘가(Over there)'라는 뜻도 가지고 있습니다.

우리는 기존에 없던 모바일 인터렉티브 UGC(사용자 제작 콘텐츠) 플랫폼을 만들기 위해 대담한 용기를 가지고 나아가는 것을 목표로 합니다.

OVERDARE는 액션 RPG, 스포츠 게임, 슈터 게임 등 다양한 게임을 제작할 수 있는 모바일 기반의 UGC 플랫폼입니다.

이용자들은 생성형 AI와 언리얼 5 엔진을 활용하여 양질의 콘텐츠를 손쉽게 제작할 수 있습니다.

뿐만 아니라 게임 제작 외에도 아바타 커스터마이징, 채팅 등 다양한 소셜 활동도 가능합니다.

또한, 메타버스 공간에서 콘텐츠 크리에이터가 다양한 저작물을 창작하면, 이용자들이 해당 저작물을 구매하고 소유하는 방식의 C2E(Create-to-Earn) 시스템을 도입하였습니다.

저작물 거래는 NFT와 블록체인을 기반으로 이루어지며, 모든 거래 내역은 블록체인에 기록되어 거래와 정산의 투명성과 신뢰성을 높였습니다.

OVERDARE는 2023년 12월에 소프트론칭되며, 내년 상반기를 목표로 글로벌 정식 출시될 예정입니다.

PUBG를 만든 크래프톤의 기술력과 제페토를 만든 네이버제트의 경험이 만나, 지금껏 경험하지 못했던 다채로운 즐거움이 가득한 새로운 플랫폼이 탄생할 거라 굳게 믿고 있습니다.

그리고 그 믿음을 더 빨리 현실화하기 위해서는 지금까지 각자의 영역에서 탄탄한 역량을 쌓아온 도전정신 가득한 여러분의 합류가 절실합니다.

Solid understanding Linux kernel internals and development principles
Deep knowledge of security as it relates to the Linux kernel
Productive in a globally distributed team through self-discipline and self-motivation, delivering on time

Our compensation philosophy is to ensure equity right across our global workforce.

In addition to a competitive base pay, we provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals.

우리는 열정과 의지를 지닌 동료들과 함께 성장하며, 글로벌 시장에서 인정받는 게임의 명가로 나아가고 있습니다.

We continuously push the boundaries of gaming enjoyment by embracing new challenges and technologies, expanding our platforms and services to captivate an even larger fan base.

In collaboration with our passionate and driven team, we strive to establish ourselves as a renowned creator of masterpieces in the global gaming market.

우리 팀(프로젝트)을 소개합니다. (Introduction of project and division)

'Good to Great!'

KRAFTON / PUBG는 Top-down을 통해서는 명작을 만들 수 없고, 유능한 팀과 이를 서포트해 줄 수 있는 시스템이 결합되어야지 ""지속 가능한 명작 제작"" 을 만들 수 있다고 생각합니다.

Game Dev Accelerator Dept.는 개발팀이 더욱 좋은 게임을 만들 수 있도록 회사가 제공하는 시스템으로서, 다양한 개발 경험을 가진 사람들이 모여 그들의 경험과 전문성을 기반으로 개발팀이 명작을 만들 수 있도록 돕고, 회사가 게임 개발과 관련하여 더욱 좋은 선택을 할 수 있도록 조언합니다.

'Good to Great!'

KRAFTON / PUBG believes that a masterpiece cannot be made through a top-down approach and we need talented teams and a system that can support them to make ""a long-lasting masterpiece"".

As a system KRAFTON provides to ensure development teams can make better games, the Game Dev Accelerator Dept. has members with diverse development experiences who have come together to help make masterpieces based on their experience and expertise, while also giving advices on game development so that the company can make a better choice.

우리 팀과 함께할 미션을 소개합니다. (Responsibilities)

게임을 제작하는데 있어서 게임의 핵심이 되는 코어 플레이는 Creator의 영역인 동시에 유저를 통해 검증해야만 하는 도전이지만, 그 외 제작 영역은 경험이 많은 분들이 전체 효율을 상승시킬 수 있는 영역입니다.

Game Dev Accelerator Dept.는 개발 경험이 많은 연륜과 경험을 갖추신 분들이 모여있는 조직으로 본인의 경험과 전문성을 바탕으로 신작 개발팀의 제작 효율을 향상시키는데 도움을 줍니다.

직접제작지원 : 개발팀이 직면한 여러가지 문제를 해결하기 위해서 개발 파이프라인 셋팅, 게임디자인 리뷰, 개발전략 및 이에 맞는 개발방식 제안 등과 같은 다양한 high-level업무를 진행합니다. 
게임 파이프라인 강화 지원 : 내부/외부 신작 게임 분석에 참여하여 Creativity, Feasibility, Potential Growth 관점에서 인사이트 공유하여 회사 방향성에 맞는 파이프라인을 갖추는데 기여합니다. 
Good to Great을 위한 유의미한 Input 제시 : 제작을 하다보면 개발리더들은 제작현실과 더 나은 게임의 중간 어느 부분에서 타협을 하게 됩니다. Game Dev Accelerator Dept.의 구성원은 개발팀이 개발 중인 게임이 Good Game에서 Great Game이 되기 위해 필요한 부분이 무엇인지 고민하고 이를 실행 하기 위한 기획, 아트, 엔지니어링 관점에서의 현실적인 아이디어를 제시합니다. 

Core play is challenging because it is the core of a game when making games, but also it is a field of creator and has to be verified through users. However, the overall efficiency of other production areas can be further enhanced with experienced members.

As an organization that consists of members with lots of development experience, the Game Dev Accelerator Dept. helps improve production efficiency of development teams working on new titles based on the members' experience and expertise.

Provide direct production support: In order to resolve various problems faced by the development team, different high-level duties are implemented, including setting up development pipeline, reviewing game design, and suggesting development strategies and suitable development method. 
Support strengthening game pipeline: Participate in internal/external analysis of new titles to share insights from the perspective of creativity, feasibility and potential growth, contributing to establishing a pipeline that suits the company's direction. 
Provide meaningful inputs to go from good to great: During the production process, development leaders will have to compromise between the reality of production and making a better game. The members of the Game Dev Accelerator Dept. suggest realistic ideas from the perspective of planning, art and engineering to think about what is needed for the game currently being developed to go from being a good game to a great game and how to implement it.

The New York Times is committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce, one that reflects the varied global community we serve. Our journalism and the products we build in the service of that journalism greatly benefit from a range of perspectives, which can only come from diversity of all types, across our ranks, at all levels of the organization.

우리는 지속적인 도전과 새로운 기술로 게임의 즐거움을 혁신하고, 더 많은 팬들에게 사랑받을 수 있도록 플랫폼과 서비스를 확장합니다.

우리는 열정과 의지를 지닌 동료들과 함께 성장하며, 글로벌 시장에서 인정받는 게임의 명가로 나아가고 있습니다.

KRAFTON is dedicated to identifying and publishing games worldwide that offer a uniquely enjoyable experience, crafted by our globally recognized production studios known for their distinctive creativity.

We continuously push the boundaries of gaming enjoyment by embracing new challenges and technologies, expanding our platforms and services to captivate an even larger fan base.

In collaboration with our passionate and driven team, we strive to establish ourselves as a renowned creator of masterpieces in the global gaming market.

우리 OVERDARE를 소개합니다.

우리는 Project Migaloo에서 OVERDARE로 재탄생 되었습니다.

이 이름은 '무모하고 대담하다'라는 뜻의 영단어인 OVERDARE로, 발음이 비슷한 '저기 어딘가(Over there)'라는 뜻도 가지고 있습니다.

우리는 기존에 없던 모바일 인터렉티브 UGC(사용자 제작 콘텐츠) 플랫폼을 만들기 위해 대담한 용기를 가지고 나아가는 것을 목표로 합니다.

OVERDARE는 액션 RPG, 스포츠 게임, 슈터 게임 등 다양한 게임을 제작할 수 있는 모바일 기반의 UGC 플랫폼입니다.

이용자들은 생성형 AI와 언리얼 5 엔진을 활용하여 양질의 콘텐츠를 손쉽게 제작할 수 있습니다.

뿐만 아니라 게임 제작 외에도 아바타 커스터마이징, 채팅 등 다양한 소셜 활동도 가능합니다.

또한, 메타버스 공간에서 콘텐츠 크리에이터가 다양한 저작물을 창작하면, 이용자들이 해당 저작물을 구매하고 소유하는 방식의 C2E(Create-to-Earn) 시스템을 도입하였습니다.

저작물 거래는 NFT와 블록체인을 기반으로 이루어지며, 모든 거래 내역은 블록체인에 기록되어 거래와 정산의 투명성과 신뢰성을 높였습니다.

OVERDARE는 2023년 12월에 소프트론칭되며, 내년 상반기를 목표로 글로벌 정식 출시될 예정입니다.

PUBG를 만든 크래프톤의 기술력과 제페토를 만든 네이버제트의 경험이 만나, 지금껏 경험하지 못했던 다채로운 즐거움이 가득한 새로운 플랫폼이 탄생할 거라 굳게 믿고 있습니다.

그리고 그 믿음을 더 빨리 현실화하기 위해서는 지금까지 각자의 영역에서 탄탄한 역량을 쌓아온 도전정신 가득한 여러분의 합류가 절실합니다.

[Frontend Team은?]

교육을 ""웹 기술로"" 다시 만드는 조직입니다. 웹 기술의 장점인 빠른 개발 / 빠른 전달 / 압도적인 개수의 플랫폼을 무기로 하여 학생들이 더 나은 교육을 받을 수 있도록 합니다. 우리는 ""정보의 평등""이라는 웹 기술의 정수를 이어받아 ""교육 기회의 평등""을 이룰 것입니다.

 글로벌 최고의 교육 서비스를 개발한다는 것: https://bit.ly/3H41e6Y


[같이 하게 될 일]

(i) 교육을 웹으로 옮기는 작업을 합니다. 
글로벌 1,300만 MAU를 가진 콴다 앱의 핵심인 ""검색 페이지""(링크)를 만듭니다
글로벌 250만 MAU의 ""콴다 웹""(링크)을 만듭니다
비대면 과외 플랫폼 ""콴다과외""(링크)를 만듭니다
(ii) 앱 안의 다양한 웹뷰와, 디자인 시스템 (QANDA Design System) 라이브러리를 개발합니다
(iii) 유저 경험과 개발 경험 개선을 위해 Frontend 기술을 발전시킵니다


[Frontend Team이 일하는 방식]

목적 조직인 TF로 나뉘어져 분기 동안 소수의 제품에만 집중할 수 있습니다
매주 기술 분야 스터디를 진행합니다. Clean Architecture, Refactoring, HTTP에 대해 학습했고, 현재 web.dev의 칼럼들을 스터디하고 있습니다
진정한 Agile 팀이 되기 위해 TDD 문화를 정착 시키고 있습니다. PO, QA팀과 테스트를 함께 작성하여 극단적으로 짧은 개발 주기를 달성할 것입니다
기술 전문가를 넘어, 문제를 해결하는 사람이 되기 위해 고민합니다


지원해주시는 분들의 가장 많이 질문 역시 “이 팀은 어떤 성향의 팀인가?” 였습니다. 많은 분들께서 궁금해 하신 만큼 저희가 먼저, 저희 팀의 특성을 블로그를 통해 소개하고자 합니다. 콴다 프론트엔드 팀의 멘탈 모델 중 가장 강력한 세 가지는 다음과 같습니다. (링크)

 자유로운 의사소통 분위기가 훌륭한 팀의 기반이다
 Agile은 모든 곳에 적용될 수 있다
 프로세스는 본질이 아니다


[We Love React]

우리는 React가 단순한 라이브러리가 아닌, 훌륭한 의사소통 언어라고 믿습니다. Frontend 개발자들의 빠른 의사소통을 위해 모든 제품을 React로 통일했습니다. 이 움직임은 Frontend 팀을 넘어 App 개발 팀에도 영감을 주어 React Native 제품을 탄생 시키기도 했습니다
이제 더 나아가 디자이너와의 소통에도 React를 도입하여 디자인과 개발 사이의 간극을 획기적으로 줄이고자 합니다. 즉, View에 대한 전사적인 유비쿼터스 언어를 만드는 것입니다. 공통 언어는 콴다 팀이 더 빠르게 교육을 혁신할 수 있게 해줄 것이고, 이 움직임의 중심에 Frontend 팀이 있습니다

NLCS Jeju seeks an experienced University Guidance Counsellor to join the team in January 2024. Students at NLCS Jeju apply to elite universities across the world. The successful candidate should have extensive knowledge in preparing students for Ivy League universities as well as experience in forming partnerships with prestigious universities. Many students at NLCS Jeju also attain scholarships, experience in this is also desirable.

NLCS (UK)

North London Collegiate School (UK) was founded in 1850 by Frances Mary Buss; her aim was to offer an academically ambitious education to girls, similar to that available to their brothers. The School has pioneered women’s education for over 160 years and remains among the highest achieving schools in the UK. Exam results regularly top the UK league tables and the School has repeatedly outperformed other prestigious schools in terms of Oxbridge success rates.

Unlike many UK independent schools, NLCS has a firm commitment to ensuring close links with its overseas branch schools. Every effort is made to replicate the ethos and standards of NLCS overseas. Wherever possible, staff for overseas schools are interviewed in London and by NLCS (UK) staff, as well as staff from our overseas schools. All teachers, once appointed, are invited to travel to London for induction and training at the UK school and this is generously funded by our partners.

Once an overseas branch is open, it is regularly monitored and inspected by the UK school, and close links are formed through pupil and staff exchanges, joint departmental projects, educational visits and extracurricular activities, such as videoconference debates and jointly produced student publications.

As the NLCS family of schools expands (with a further overseas school opened in Singapore in 2020), it is hoped that partnership activities will expand so that each school in the group develops links with the others. We also hope to see staff join the group in order to build their career with us and benefit from the many professional development and career-progression opportunities, which a group of world-class schools such as ours can offer.

NTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS 

In 2011, NLCS opened its first international branch school in South Korea NLCS Jeju. NLCS Jeju is a co-educational day and boarding school, and offers the IB Diploma to all students in the Sixth Form, and has achieved outstanding results since its first cohort of graduating in 2014. The School’s alumnae continue on to excellent universities around the world, including destinations in the UK, USA and Asia.

 
In September 2017, NLCS opened its second branch school in the UAE NLCS Dubai. The School is a co-educational, day school, following the IB Continuum, with pupils undertaking the IB Diploma in Grade 12.

 
NLCS (Singapore) opened in August 2020. This is NLCS’ third branch school. The School is a co-education day school in the heart of Singapore. North London Collegiate School Ho Chi Minh City opened in August 2022. This is NLCS’s fourth school blending the best of Vietnamese, NLCS and international education for its students.

 
NLCS JEJU

 
North London Collegiate School Jeju (NLCS Jeju) is a leading British International school providing an exceptional education experience for 1500 day and boarding students aged 4-18.  The first international school to be opened in the vibrant Global Education City on the spectacular South Korean Island of Jeju, NLCS Jeju has rapidly established itself as a centre of educational excellence in South East Asia.

The School, now entering its eleventh year of operation, has nearly 1500 students on the roll.  NLCS Jeju offers the IB Diploma to all in the Sixth Form and has achieved outstanding results since its first cohort of graduating students in 2014. Over the last 4 years our average points score has been over 38 points and we have students achieving the perfect score as well as significant numbers of students achieving 40+points .

 
THE ETHOS

The ethos of NLCS Jeju echoes that of NLCS (UK) – every effort is made to recreate the ethos of the UK ‘parent’ school, whilst taking into account and remaining sensitive to the local culture and context.

 
The School aims to provide a first-rate ambitious academic education for every child, which inspires a life-long love of learning and gives the knowledge, attitudes and confidence to flourish.

 
At North London Collegiate schools, academic success is gained, not through an emphasis on results, by creating an atmosphere of rigorous scholarship; students are encouraged to study beyond the examination syllabus in order to develop their intellectual independence and love of their subjects. The pastoral well-being is of the utmost importance and good relationships are fostered between students and staff, as well as between the students themselves.

 
The co-curricular life of NLCS schools is vibrant, both in academic and non-academic fields. Students participate in a wide range of subject-focussed clubs and societies, from weekly book groups to Debating, to ‘Mad Scientists’ and ‘Model United Nations’. In the UK School, over forty academic clubs and societies operate weekly meetings and events, in order to give every opportunity for students to develop their intellectual curiosity, independence of thought and genuine love of subject; there are a large number of student-produced academic journals which reflect the particular interests of these societies. Non-academic activities also thrive as NLCS schools aims to create an environment in which the whole personality can grow. Co-curricular Sport, Music, Art and Drama are all of excellent quality and over seventy activities take place at lunch times and after school each day, with large numbers involved.

 
THE CURRICULUM 

Students take IGCSEs and then follow the IBDP. This will be supported by an extensive co-curricular programme of Sport, Music, Drama and other activities, which closely reflects that at NLCS (UK), are provided to enrich and broaden the education offered, developing the talents and confidence of students.

 
LIFE IN JEJU

Jeju Island, 130km off the southern coast of the Korean peninsula, is often described as one of Asia’s best-kept secrets. Jeju’s temperate climate, natural scenery and beaches make it a popular tourist destination for South Koreans as well as visitors from other parts of East Asia.

 
In 2007, UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee listed Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes as a World Natural Heritage site. The island also possesses outstanding geological features and special properties as a habitat for a variety of rare and endangered species.

 
Jeju provides NLCS staff and their families with a safe, peaceful and breath-taking environment in which to live. The employment pages on the NLCS Jeju website contain further practical information about life in Jeju.

  
SAFEGUARDING AND CHILD PROTECTION

The School is committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people. All staff and volunteers are expected to share this commitment. This post is subject to satisfactory background and police checks.

크래프톤은 차별화된 크리에이티브를 가진 글로벌 제작 스튜디오들과 고유한 즐거움이 있는 게임을 발굴하여 전 세계에 퍼블리싱합니다.

우리는 지속적인 도전과 새로운 기술로 게임의 즐거움을 혁신하고, 더 많은 팬들에게 사랑받을 수 있도록 플랫폼과 서비스를 확장합니다.

우리는 열정과 의지를 지닌 동료들과 함께 성장하며, 글로벌 시장에서 인정받는 게임의 명가로 나아가고 있습니다.

KRAFTON is dedicated to identifying and publishing games worldwide that offer a uniquely enjoyable experience, crafted by our globally recognized production studios known for their distinctive creativity.

We continuously push the boundaries of gaming enjoyment by embracing new challenges and technologies, expanding our platforms and services to captivate an even larger fan base.

In collaboration with our passionate and driven team, we strive to establish ourselves as a renowned creator of masterpieces in the global gaming market.

우리 OVERDARE를 소개합니다.

우리는 Project Migaloo에서 OVERDARE로 재탄생 되었습니다.

이 이름은 '무모하고 대담하다'라는 뜻의 영단어인 OVERDARE로, 발음이 비슷한 '저기 어딘가(Over there)'라는 뜻도 가지고 있습니다.

우리는 기존에 없던 모바일 인터렉티브 UGC(사용자 제작 콘텐츠) 플랫폼을 만들기 위해 대담한 용기를 가지고 나아가는 것을 목표로 합니다.

OVERDARE는 액션 RPG, 스포츠 게임, 슈터 게임 등 다양한 게임을 제작할 수 있는 모바일 기반의 UGC 플랫폼입니다.

이용자들은 생성형 AI와 언리얼 5 엔진을 활용하여 양질의 콘텐츠를 손쉽게 제작할 수 있습니다.

뿐만 아니라 게임 제작 외에도 아바타 커스터마이징, 채팅 등 다양한 소셜 활동도 가능합니다.

또한, 메타버스 공간에서 콘텐츠 크리에이터가 다양한 저작물을 창작하면, 이용자들이 해당 저작물을 구매하고 소유하는 방식의 C2E(Create-to-Earn) 시스템을 도입하였습니다.

저작물 거래는 NFT와 블록체인을 기반으로 이루어지며, 모든 거래 내역은 블록체인에 기록되어 거래와 정산의 투명성과 신뢰성을 높였습니다.

OVERDARE는 2023년 12월에 소프트론칭되며, 내년 상반기를 목표로 글로벌 정식 출시될 예정입니다.

PUBG를 만든 크래프톤의 기술력과 제페토를 만든 네이버제트의 경험이 만나, 지금껏 경험하지 못했던 다채로운 즐거움이 가득한 새로운 플랫폼이 탄생할 거라 굳게 믿고 있습니다.

그리고 그 믿음을 더 빨리 현실화하기 위해서는 지금까지 각자의 영역에서 탄탄한 역량을 쌓아온 도전정신 가득한 여러분의 합류가 절실합니다.

이에 대한 자세한 설명은 https://careers.overdare.com/ 에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.

크래프톤은 차별화된 크리에이티브를 가진 글로벌 제작 스튜디오들과 고유한 즐거움이 있는 게임을 발굴하여 전 세계에 퍼블리싱합니다.

우리는 지속적인 도전과 새로운 기술로 게임의 즐거움을 혁신하고, 더 많은 팬들에게 사랑받을 수 있도록 플랫폼과 서비스를 확장합니다.

우리는 열정과 의지를 지닌 동료들과 함께 성장하며, 글로벌 시장에서 인정받는 게임의 명가로 나아가고 있습니다.

KRAFTON is dedicated to identifying and publishing games worldwide that offer a uniquely enjoyable experience, crafted by our globally recognized production studios known for their distinctive creativity.

We continuously push the boundaries of gaming enjoyment by embracing new challenges and technologies, expanding our platforms and services to captivate an even larger fan base.

In collaboration with our passionate and driven team, we strive to establish ourselves as a renowned creator of masterpieces in the global gaming market.

우리 OVERDARE를 소개합니다.

우리는 Project Migaloo에서 OVERDARE로 재탄생 되었습니다.

이 이름은 '무모하고 대담하다'라는 뜻의 영단어인 OVERDARE로, 발음이 비슷한 '저기 어딘가(Over there)'라는 뜻도 가지고 있습니다.

우리는 기존에 없던 모바일 인터렉티브 UGC(사용자 제작 콘텐츠) 플랫폼을 만들기 위해 대담한 용기를 가지고 나아가는 것을 목표로 합니다.

OVERDARE는 액션 RPG, 스포츠 게임, 슈터 게임 등 다양한 게임을 제작할 수 있는 모바일 기반의 UGC 플랫폼입니다.

이용자들은 생성형 AI와 언리얼 5 엔진을 활용하여 양질의 콘텐츠를 손쉽게 제작할 수 있습니다.

뿐만 아니라 게임 제작 외에도 아바타 커스터마이징, 채팅 등 다양한 소셜 활동도 가능합니다.

또한, 메타버스 공간에서 콘텐츠 크리에이터가 다양한 저작물을 창작하면, 이용자들이 해당 저작물을 구매하고 소유하는 방식의 C2E(Create-to-Earn) 시스템을 도입하였습니다.

저작물 거래는 NFT와 블록체인을 기반으로 이루어지며, 모든 거래 내역은 블록체인에 기록되어 거래와 정산의 투명성과 신뢰성을 높였습니다.

OVERDARE는 2023년 12월에 소프트론칭되며, 내년 상반기를 목표로 글로벌 정식 출시될 예정입니다.

PUBG를 만든 크래프톤의 기술력과 제페토를 만든 네이버제트의 경험이 만나, 지금껏 경험하지 못했던 다채로운 즐거움이 가득한 새로운 플랫폼이 탄생할 거라 굳게 믿고 있습니다.

그리고 그 믿음을 더 빨리 현실화하기 위해서는 지금까지 각자의 영역에서 탄탄한 역량을 쌓아온 도전정신 가득한 여러분의 합류가 절실합니다.
