Coop: Data Analyst,"Amby · Oslo, Oslo, Norway  1 month ago  · 30 applicants","About the job
Join Coop's Supply Chain team as a Data Analyst and enhance our operations with your valuable insights! 

Coop is owned by 2 million co-owners. This sets us apart from competitors and is reflected in our vision - choosing Coop should be rewarding. Ownership offers the opportunity to influence and to share in the profits generated. 150 years after the establishment of the first consumer cooperative, Coop is still working towards the same goal - rooted in the same values. The cooperative societies collectively own the umbrella organization, Coop Norge SA, which is responsible for Coop's joint procurement, wholesale and logistics operations, chain management, brand-building, and membership program.

Supply Chain at Coop

Coop Norge introduced our Supply Chain department in August 2022. The department consists of four main areas: inbound supply management, forecasting & replenishment, store ordering, and ordering solutions.

The Supply Chain department is integrated within the broader Logistics Department at Coop Norge, which is renowned as one of Norway's premier logistics entities. Logistics operations are at the core of the flow of goods - from supplier to warehouse and store. Our logistics operations consist of a fully automated logistics center at Gardermoen and 5 local warehouse units; together with the transportation operations, this forms the backbone of our value chain.

For the road ahead, the strategy is clear - by prioritizing customer service and increased cost-effectiveness, we aim to continue our growth. To achieve this goal, we need to strengthen our capacity in the field of analysis.

You have hands-on experience with at least one public cloud
You are familiar with Docker and Kubernetes
You are an experienced Python programmer and enjoy challenging projects
You understand the importance of reliable software and strive to design and code to that expectation
You are organized and want your team to deliver timely, high quality software

About Canonical

We value, above all else, applicants who are passionate about making a positive difference in the world. Please write 3 sentences in the “Message to Hiring Manager” portion of your application telling us why you are specifically interested in working with DHIS2. It doesn't have to be a lengthy cover letter, we just want to know that you have at least reviewed our website (dhis2.org) and want to join us in our mission.

Diversity and Inclusion

The people designing and building DHIS2 should reflect the people of every imaginable background, identity, gender, religion, ability, and nationality in more than 100 countries and on 6 continents worldwide who rely on it.

What we are looking for in you

Background in data science, mathematics, actuarial science, or engineering
First work experience in People Analytics

Ability to translate business questions to key research objectives
Ability to identify the best methodology to execute research, synthesize and analyse findings
Excellent writing and communication skills
Willingness to examine the status quo and resilient in the face of challenges

What we offer you

Stipendiat i nevromodellering,"UNIVERSITETET I STAVANGER · Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway  1 month ago  · 2 applicants","About the job
Om stillingen

Universitetet i Stavanger har ledig stilling som stipendiat i psykologi innenfor nevromodellering ved Det samfunnsvitenskapelige fakultet, Institutt for sosialfag. Stillingen er ledig fra 01.01.2024.

Dette er en utdanningsstilling som i hovedsak skal gi lovende forskere anledning til faglig utvikling gjennom en forskerutdanning.

Den som ansettes vil bli tatt opp på doktorgradsprogrammet i samfunnsvitenskap. Programmet omfatter relevante kurs i et omfang som tilsvarer omkring et halvt års studium, en avhandling basert på selvstendig forskning, deltakelse i nasjonale og internasjonale forskermiljø, relevant forskningsformidling, prøveforelesning og disputas. Les mer om forskerutdanningen ved UiS på våre nettsider.

Stipendiaten ansettes for en periode på tre år med ren forskerutdanning.

Stillingen er eksternt finansiert med midler fra Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Forskningstema

Den som ansettes vil være tilknyttet til forskningsprosjektet MRmodel, som er et internasjonalt konsortium med Muriel Bruchhage (UiS) som prosjektleder. Vi søker etter en svært motivert kandidat med interesse for nevromodellering for å undersøke hvordan tidlig hjerneutvikling kan relateres til kognitiv utvikling.

Konvensjonelle magnetiske resonansavbildningssystemer (magnetic resonance imaging; MRI) anvender sterke magnetiske felt (1,5 Tesla og over) som krever strenge, tilgangskontrollerte miljøer og omfattende vedlikehold, samt høyt utdannet personell. Som en konsekvens er tilgangen til høyfelts MR-skannere svært begrenset i lav- og mellominntektsland (low- and middle income countries; LMICs). En ny generasjon av lavfelt MR-skannere (for eksempel fra produsenten Hyperfine) muliggjør sikker og mobil skanning til mye lavere kostnader, noe som åpner nye og bredere bruksområder - inkludert LMIC kohorter. MRmodel prosjektet bruker Hyperfine lavfelt- og konvensjonell høyfelt-MR data, sammen med nevrokognitive og miljømessige vurderinger, som blir innhentet fra både høyinntekts- og LMIC-kohorter rundt om i verden. Prosjektets mål er å videreutvikle ulike nevromodelleringsmetoder for best mulig å identifisere barn som vil slite med å oppnå sin optimale kognitive utvikling.

Innenfor dette prosjektet vil du identifisere og følge opp barn med sårbarhet (på grunn av hjerneutvikling, medisinske tilstander eller andre omstendigheter) og sammenligne dem med barn som er resiliente (motstandsdyktige). Her vil målet ditt være å undersøke og forutsi deres utvikling med varierende kognisjon og miljø på tvers av kohortene. For dette vil du kombinere avanserte maskinlæringsteknikker og nye statistiske strategier for å analysere dataene dine, integrere funnene dine med vårt større konsortium og sammenligne prediksjonene dine med pågående målinger.

Prosjektskisse

Som søker må du utarbeide en foreløpig prosjektskisse for et doktorgradsprosjekt innenfor forskningstema der det gjøres rede for problemstilling, relevans, teoretisk- og metodisk tilnærming. Prosjektskissen vil inngå i kompetansevurderingen.

I løpet av de tre første månedene av ansettelsesperioden vil prosjektskissen og fremdriftsplan bli videreutviklet i samarbeid med veilederne og utformet til den endelige planen for ph.d.-prosjektet. Mal for prosjektskisse finner du her.

Prosjektskissen bør ikke være på mer enn én side.

Kvalifikasjoner

Du må ha en sterk faglig bakgrunn med femårig mastergrad (3+2) innenfor nevrovitenskap, psykologi, kognitiv nevrovitenskap, bioinformatikk, ingeniørfag eller tilsvarende utdanning som gir grunnlag for å gjennomføre en forskerutdanning, fortrinnsvis av nyere dato. Dette vil omfatte, men er ikke begrenset til deg som har gjennomført emner på minst 240 studiepoeng, hvorav minst 60 studiepoeng er fra høyere syklusemner, eller har tilegnet deg tilsvarende kunnskap.

Dersom karakteren din på masteroppgaven og veid gjennomsnittskarakter på masterstudiet begge hver for seg tilsvarer B eller bedre, er du den vi søker etter. Avslutter du utdanningen din høsten 2023 er du også velkommen til å søke.

Dersom du har utdannelse fra en institusjon med annen karakterskala enn A-F ber vi deg om å legge ved en bekreftet konverteringsskala som viser hvordan karakterene kan sammenliknes med den norske A-F skalaen. Du kan bruke disse konverteringsskalaene til å beregne poengene dine for opptak.

spesiell interesse for pediatri og global helse
programmeringsferdigheter (Matlab, R, Python)
kunnskap om statistisk modellering
tidligere forskningserfaring
erfaring med MRI eller andre bildegivende metoder

Bouvet er et skandinavisk konsulentselskap som designer, utvikler, forvalter og gir råd om IT-løsninger og digital kommunikasjon. Sammen med våre kunder skaper Bouvet digitale løsninger med stor betydning for samfunnet.

Bouvet ønsker å være et verdibasert konsulentselskap. Vi rekrutterer våre medarbeidere etter et sett verdier og ønsker at våre leveranser og kundeforhold også skal reflektere disse. Verdiene vi lever etter er delingskultur, jordnærhet, entusiasme, troverdighet og frihet. Bouvet har 14 kontorer i Norge og Sverige, noe som setter oss i stand til å forstå kundens språk, kultur og forretning. Slik kan vi forankre og løse de fleste oppdrag lokalt.

Bouvet har et av Norges ledende miljøer innen Power Platform med over 100 konsulenter og ønsker å bygge videre på det. Derfor ser vi nå etter kloke hoder som kan bistå med å bygge fremtidens samfunn sammen med viktige og samfunnskritiske kunder.

Vi søker deg som har teknisk erfaring med Power Platform, liker å være tett på kunden og gi dem gode råd. Du har ulik kompetanse innenfor plattformen, og ser verdien i ulike tilnærminger til løsningene som kunden har behov for. Enten du interesserer deg for det tekniske eller funksjonelle så er dette noe for deg!

Du kan være en som har vært med lenge og som tar ledelsen i kontakten med kunden eller du kan være litt ferskere, arbeide med løsningene og ønsker å lene deg litt på seniorene før du selv tar prosess-diskusjonene med kunden.

I Rollen Kan Du Ha Følgende Ansvarsområder

Være i kryssningspunktet mellom utvikling og rådgivning
Planlegge, utvikle og implementere nye løsninger
Videreutvikle eksisterende løsninger du kjenner godt
Være en støttespiller for kundene og gi de gode råd om plattformen
Følge med utviklingen innenfor Power Platform og sikre at vi informerer kunde om nye muligheter i plattformen

Dette vil du løse med glans om du kjenner deg igjen i noen av disse kvalifikasjonene:

Du bør ha gode tekniske ferdigheter i Power Platform
Du er opptatt av å lage brukerorienterte løsninger i skjæringspunktet mellom teknologi og forretning
Du er nysgjerrig på ny teknologi og har god systemforståelse
Du ønsker å bidra i et fagmiljø og dele kunnskap med andre

Det Er Også Fint Om Du Har

Kjennskap til Microsoft 365 og/eller Dynamics 365
Du har en IT-relatert universitets- eller høyskoleutdannelse eller relevant erfaring

Ingen dager som konsulent hos oss er like, men vi tror det kan se litt ut som dette:

08.30 Drikker dagens første kaffe (vi har god kaffe) mens du går gjennom e-post og teamets oppgaver.

09.00 Kort avsjekk med teamet. Dere drøfter oppgavene som er gjort og skal gjøres

09:15 Kunden har etterspurt en endring i en løsning du jobber med. Du må gjøre litt research i forveien.

10.00 Nå er det klar for å starte arbeidet med løsningen og det knastes på tastaturet

11.30 Spise lunsj i kantina med kollegaer og prater om hva du skal i helgen

12.00 Du fortsetter å jobbe med løsningen. Du står litt fast og får hjelp av en på teamet

15.00 Du har testet ferdig, og trykker på push-knappen. Endelig kan du lene deg godt tilbake i stolen. I morgen er det demo for kunden, og du starter forberedelsene.

16.00 Du drar hjem, eller i barnehagen, eller på trening, eller kanskje du tar en tur i badstue med noen kollegaer?

Her er utvalg av våre gulrøtter som du får hos oss:

🥕 Du får din egen utviklingsplan. Hos oss vil du få god oppfølgning og muligheten til å fordype deg på og bevege deg mellom fagfelt, bransjer og roller.

🥕 Hos oss får du oppgaver som er faglig utfordrende, i prosjekter som veldig ofte påvirker langt flere enn oppdragsgiveren.

🥕 Du får ha et liv utenfor jobben. Frihet og fritid er viktige verdier hos oss. Du får tilpasse hverdagen din etter dine behov.

🥕 Alle får bonus. Prestasjonsbasert lønn og individuelle bonuser er ikke noe for oss. Vi gir deg trygghet med fast lønn og overskuddsdeling (bonusordning), og du får selvsagt betalt for overtid i perioder du må stå på litt ekstra.

Vi har selvfølgelig mange flere gulrøtter. De finner du i vår Gulrotindeks her 🥕

Digital signal processing engineer,"Monil · Lysaker, Viken, Norway  5 days ago  · 9 applicants","About the job
The firmware team

The firmware engineering team makes the software that runs on the animal collar. This includes working with a wide variety of sensors to figure out where the animal is located, how it is moving and other vital signs. The collar needs a reliable wireless connection with the outside world, but to save power we want to use this as little as possible. So the collar needs to process complex sensor data locally and provide precise and intuitive feedback to the animal. All of this needs to be done on an extreme power budget and delivered at an aggressive timeline.

We are working in a fast paced development environment deploying firmware on thousands of devices in the field Over-The-Air. The firmware, written mainly in C, is running on an RTOS on a modern ARM Cortex CPU and is thoroughly tested for both logical and power consumption bugs in our continuous integration environment. Our GNSS and inertial sensors need to be characterised and calibrated, before the data can be processed to make sense of the world. For this we use both analytical signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms optimised for low power embedded systems.

All of these tasks are done in close collaboration with the backend and client software engineers, hardware and mechanical engineers as well as the farmers and of course the animals themselves.

About The Job

We are looking for skilled digital signal processing engineer to join our firmware team.

The responsibilities and tasks include:

Working with our GNSS chipsets and inertial sensors and characterising and calibrating these to produce precise data. 
Develop algorithms to process the data locally on the collar by using a combination of analytical signal processing techniques and machine trained embedded inference algorithms.

While you will be working mainly on the sensor algorithms themselves, you will be working closely with the rest of the firmware team as well as the hardware and software engineers. Last but not least, you will get to test yourself how well your algorithms work in practice with the animals themselves.

It is beneficial if you have

Experience in digital signal processing
Experience with inertial sensors and satellite positioning
Experience in machine learning techniques, either using classical techniques or neural networks. 
Experience in embedded software development
Want to be visible and take on responsibility for finding good overall sensor solutions.

We can offer

An opportunity to make a real difference in Monil’s products and services, innovating and applying creativity to solve real-world problems with high stakes.
A chance to join a promising and well-backed startup with big ambitions in an early phase, with opportunities for personal and professional growth.
Work together with experienced industry specialists in a variety of fields – from mechanics and electronics to embedded, backend and frontend software.
IT equipment and tools of your choice.
Competitive salary and benefits.
Equity in the company."

Strong ability to prioritize and “get sh*t done”. You possess a strong sense of urgency in driving projects to completion. Can speak to past experiences of getting projects across the finish line repeatedly and on-time.
Strong written and verbal communication skills along with the ability to explain technical topics to non-technical audiences.
You’re naturally curious, love learning new things, and are proactive in sharing knowledge with others.
High tolerance for ambiguity. You should be excited that your priorities will change over time, in large part based on what you see as the highest-impact end user issues that need to be resolved.

PhD Candidate –Designing user interfaces for human-machine teaming for autonomous passenger ferries,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) · Trondheim, Trøndelag, Norway  3 weeks ago  · 4 applicants","About the job
About The Job

The Autoteaming project will develop new technologies and user interfaces for seamless human-machine teaming for the operation of autonomous urban passenger ferries.

Recent technology advancements in machine autonomy have demonstrated the potential to significantly enhance maritime operations by improving efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Contemporary design has been guided by the conviction that technology should replace tasks normally done by humans. The problem with this approach is that when the unexpected happens or when the automation inevitably fails, a human navigator must be in the loop to take swift and decisive preventative actions.

Therefore, to succeed at leveraging the advantages of advanced automation, the technologies must be designed to support navigators, not supplant them. Our vision is that humans and machines can form effective teams, and we intend to demonstrate this with small-scale autonomous urban ferries supervised from a fully integrated remote control centre. This will be accomplished by combining our existing world-leading research infrastructures, including two proven autonomous urban passenger ferry prototypes and a laboratory dedicated to remote supervisory control of maritime operations.

The overall goal of the project is a new operational mode we call “Autoteaming,” where machines and humans co-exist with seamless communication and shared control. The Department of Design has a vacancy for a PhD position in the Autoteaming project to design the user interface for human-machine teaming. The PhD candidate will be part of a multidisciplinary team of researchers. The position’s working place is at the NTNU Shore Control Lab in Trondheim.

Your immediate leader is the Head of Department.

Duties of the position

Designing user interfaces for the supervision and control of autonomous urban ferries
Conducting high-quality research and reporting progress on a regular basis and in agreement with the supervisors.
Documenting the research findings in the form of scientific papers.
Presenting the research findings at internal project meetings and scientific conferences.
Undertaking the necessary courses (30 ECTS) as part of the PhD program.

Required Selection Criteria

Have a relevant background in interaction design, computer science, software engineering, human-computer interaction, human factors, or related fields. 
Have completed at least five years of higher education that includes a master’s degree or other equivalent degree, where 120 credits have been obtained at master's level.
Have a strong academic record and a weighted average for the last two years of your master's degree equivalent to a B or higher according to the NTNU's grading scale. If you do not have letter grades from previous studies, you must have an equally good academic basis. If you have a weaker result, you may be assessed if you can document that you are particularly suitable for a PhD education.
Meet the requirements for admission to the doctoral program in design .
Have very good written and oral English language skills. Candidates from universities outside Scandinavia and English-speaking countries are requested to document English language proficiency:
TOEFL: 600 (paper-based test), 92 (Internet-based test)

UX Designer,"Aidn · Oslo, Oslo, Norway  5 days ago  · 228 applicants","About the job
We all have family and friends that have had less than satisfying run-ins with the healthcare system, repeating their story to new healthcare workers without access to the relevant records. Again and again. New faces. Same story. Binders hauled between offices explaining treatments. Time wasted. Patients suffering. They shouldn’t have to.

Healthcare systems are not coordinated. Not synchronized. They don’t communicate. Healthcare professionals need to record identical activities and measures in multiple systems. We don’t suffer from a lack of information in healthcare. We suffer from information sprawl. We shouldn’t have to.

As product builders, the work we do is important to our employers, but, at some point, we all ask ourselves the same question: Is the work itself important?

Our ambition is to give Norwegians the missing healthcare platform they deserve. An integrated set of products and services to allow institutions, clinicians, social workers, and citizens to seamlessly interact on healthcare matters.

That’s where you come in. Here’s your chance to put your talents to work for a purpose.

We are looking for a UX Designer for one of our product teams.

At Aidn, we believe that talented designers, engineers, and product managers should be allowed to work autonomously toward long-term goals. Together with designers, developers, nurses, and doctors, you will be instrumental in creating the future patient-centric eHealth system.

Here, you will:

Create user-centric designs by considering market analysis, data, customer feedback, user research, and technical constraints/opportunities
Create user flows, wireframes, design mockups and prototypes to effectively conceptualize new product initiatives
Conduct user research, interviews and testing
Simplify complex processes into intuitive and elegant user experiences
Use your experience with accessibility and inclusive design
Communicate complex, interactive design concepts in a simple manner
Follow up on the performance of designs on the basis of conversion rate and user heat maps

We think you have experience with some of this:

Working in a modern product development organization
Contributing to product discovery
Working with other designers across multiple product teams
Contributing to hypotheses, metrics for success of the designs and follow up their performance on the basis of conversion rate and user heat maps
Create user-centered designs by considering customer feedback, user research and technical constraints/opportunities
Contributing to user research, interviews and testing
Experience creating user flows, wireframes, design mockups, and prototypes to effectively conceptualize new product initiatives
Accessibility and inclusive design
Communicating complex, interactive design concepts in a simple manner
Bachelor-level education, within the design field (industrial, product, digital, service). Can be substituted by similar work experience.

If you have the skills, experience, and drive to juggle these varied responsibilities, we have the right team for you. Aidn has seven product teams at the moment, each with a product manager, a tech lead, a design lead, and other engineers and designers. The UX designer will report to the Director of Design.

Other things to get excited about:

6 weeks of vacation
Work where it suits you, at home or one of our offices in Bergen, Bodø or Oslo. Or maybe all of the above?
Opportunity to take part in our employee share scheme
The opportunity to contribute with your work, to a purpose-driven company

And there’s more! Aidn has the advantage of being a member of the Kernel family, a collection of like-minded companies focused on building the next generation of health services for Norway and beyond. This association gives us access to advisors across the entire healthcare ecosystem, sufficient capital to support the long runways required by our ambitions, and the strategic partnerships needed to realize cooperation across today’s siloed landscape.

We think you are intrigued by this. We believe you want to join us. And we think you know why. We believe you want to put your talents to work for a purpose.

Are you curious? We welcome you to check out our employee handbook to get to know us, some of our benefits, and what drives us."

Most importantly, the support and materials help every child develop skills, confidence, and a firm conviction that they are capable.

We’re looking for an Assistant Guide who will bring their best in order to support every child in reaching their highest potential!

Guidepost Assistant Guides:

Observe children closely to understand and best meet their needs

A network of supportive peers and mentors who appreciate your valuable contributions and regularly share best practices 
Abundant career growth and promotion opportunities
A competitive salary
Health, dental, and vision insurance

About Us

Guidepost Montessori is a growing network of 100+ Montessori schools, serving children ages 0-12 in our Nido, Toddler, Children’s House, and Elementary programs.

Quality Control Technician - Relocation to Malta,Magro Brothers · Norway  2 weeks ago  · 18 applicants,"About the job
Magro Brothers Group of Companies is a private, family-owned organisation. It finds its roots in 1916 when three Magro brothers joined their father`s business as general provisions merchants.

In 1934 they ventured in the processing and canning of fresh tomatoes and subsequently branched into a number of other business activities including the importation into Malta of livestock, fodder and foodstuffs and exports of local agricultural produce.

In 1977, John and Michael Magro, the sons of one of the first partners, took over the running of the business and further expanded their activities to include tinplate can manufacture, food distribution, retailing, advertising & marketing, property development.

In 1995, the company moved to a purposely built factory with a covered area of 27,000 square metres which today has become a centre of excellence for food processing in the Mediterranean.

In December 2013, John and Michael, being the 3rd generation in the Magro Brothers business enterprise, transferred their shares to John’s children namely, Christian, Nicholas and Joanna. Christian was appointed C.E.O. of the Group in January 2018 while John remains chairman of the Group and Michael continues to form part of the main board of directors.

The backbone of the food sector of Magro Brothers Group of Companies is still the processing of fresh tomatoes – Magro Brothers (Foods) Ltd is the major company within the group. It is one of the few local companies which handle the whole production cycle of tomato related products, from the growing of crops to the distribution of the finished product. This also includes the production of tinplate-cans. The present production range is very diversified and includes canned tomatoes, table and pasta sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise and other condiments, thin sauces, jams and ready-to-eat jellies.

The company is also well established in several overseas markets with sales offices in UK and Ireland supplying high profile international brands. Presently the company exports some 45% of its production to 20 countries spread in four continents.

In 2004, as part of the company’s policy of diversification and living up to market expectations, Magro Brothers Group expanded their business to offer exclusive gifting and hampers of Maltese delicacies and crafts under the Savina Brand and, in 2010 they ventured also in the production of traditional Maltese cheeses and dairy products under the popular Hanini Brand.

Today, with over 100 years’ experience, Magro Brothers Group of Companies has become one of the leading enterprises in Malta and has gained the respect of the local business community and the trust of most financial and commercial organisations. The owners take pride into rigorously monitoring the crops and herds of the many Maltese and Gozitan farmers who regularly supply fresh agricultural produce and milk to their organisation. This has helped the company to achieve the well-deserved premier position in food processing in Malta.

The company is very proud of its Quality credentials and boasts a BRC Grade AA food safety certification, an Organic certification and ISO 22000. They offer brand owners a wealth of manufacturing expertise and specialize in private label.

Sommerjobb i 2024,"NoA Ignite Norway · Oslo, Oslo, Norway  1 month ago  · 40 applicants","About the job
Sommerjobb 2024 i NoA Ignite?
 Ser du for deg en karriere innen frontend, backend eller data engineering? Eller som en designer av digitale løsninger? Flaks! Vi ser allerede nå etter hele 12 studenter som har lyst å tilbringe sommeren 2024 hos oss i NoA Ignite. 
NoA Ignite er det største selskapet i The North Alliance — en progressiv byråfamilie med flere av de fremste strategi-, design-, teknologi- og kommunikasjonsselskapene i Norden. 
Vi i Ignite liker å se oss selv som et kraftsenter for alle typer digital vekst! Våre tverrfaglige team jobber i partnerskap med kundene for å finne nye måter å skape bærekraftige og forretningsorienterte digitale løsninger. Kombinert med innovasjon, personlig engasjement og en tydelig forretningsverdi blir dette solide digitale plattformer, e-handelsløsninger, datadrevne produkter og tjenester, nettsteder og apper vi vi er stolte av. Visste du at vi er kåret til ett av de mest innovative selskapene? 
Vi bruker sommerjobb som en rekrutteringskanal, Frøydis deler her sin opplevelse fra å gå fra sommerjobb til fast ansettelse. 

Årets oppgave:  Automatisering og prediksjonsmodeller. 
Som Summer-Intern hos oss i NoA Ignite får du mulighet til å jobbe på et prosjekt for noen av våre kunder. Du og de andre studentene vil jobbe i tverrfaglige team, veiledet av våre dyktige ansatte.
 Masterstudentene i år har over flere uker jobbet intensivt med nye løsninger for Meny og Avonova. For Meny har studentene utforsket hvordan prediktive modeller kan gjøre nettbutikkhandelen bedre med vareforslag. Det andre studentteamet har jobbet med å automatisere årsrapporten Avonova hvert år sender ut til sine kunder.
Felles for prosjektene er at de handler om å tilgjengeliggjøre data på en måte som gjør løsningen enklere og raskere å bruke. På denne måten skapte de verdi både for kunden og sluttbrukeren. Med fokus på brukeropplevelse og automatisering, endte Avonova-gjengen opp med en imponerende effektivisering av prosessen med å lage årsrapporter. Meny-teamets fokus på maskinlæring, brukerreise og design førte til et kjempeløft av handleopplevelsen i Meny-appen.
Hva oppgaven blir til neste år er foreløpig en overraskelse, men vi kan love minst like spennende utfordringer. Her kan du lese enda mer om årets prosjekt. I tillegg til å jobbe på prosjekt er det også mye hyggelig og sosialt som skjer. Det er jo tross alt sommer..
 

Hvem er så du? 
Om du er en student av det kreative slaget som holder på med et eller annet slags teknologi- eller designprogram ved universitet eller høgskole, vil vi gjerne høre fra deg. Mest sannsynligvis skal du i disse dager ta fatt på masterstudiet ditt. Kanskje klør det i fingrene etter å få arbeidserfaring som vil hjelpe deg med å utvikle ferdighetene dine og gi deg forståelse av hvordan det er å jobbe som konsulent. 
Har du gjort noen spennende prosjekter i studietiden som du kan vise til, vært aktiv i foreningsarbeid eller hatt relevant arbeidserfaring fra før av? Fortell oss gjerne om det når du sender oss din CV og søknad! Husk også å legge med karakterutskrift for studiene så langt. 

Hva kan vi tilby?
Målet vårt er først og fremst å skape et fantastisk sted å vokse og å være viktig partner for kundene våre. For å lykkes med det tenker vi både med hodet og hjertet, og gjør jobben vår med integritet og stolthet. Vi har selvfølgelig konkurransedyktige betingelser og tilbyr blant annet:
Å bli kjent med oss og de andre studentene før dere deles inn i team
En sosial sommer med mange aktiviteter
Små kurs innen design og utvikling på tvers om du er teknolog eller designer
Sentrale kontorer ved Stortinget og en del av et stort kreativt miljø
Mulighet til å ta egne valg i prosjektet. Dere får veiledning underveis, men også stor frihet til å velge teknologi og ta designavgjørelser selv
Gjennomprøvde og gode prosesser for strukturert teamarbeid som dere lærer av våre dyktige prosjektledere
 Frokost, lunsj, ettermiddagssnacks i kantinen, som er kåret til Norges beste. Vi har egen kaffebar og barista, og perfekt brygget «dagens kaffe». Make Office Coffee Great again! 
Et trygt arbeidsmiljø som verdsetter deg og din kunnskap
Relevante prosjekter som bygger CVen din! 

Vi vurderer søknader kontinuerlig og ser frem til å høre fra deg, men husk å sende inn din søknad før fristen 1. oktober!
Om prosessen:
Vi kaller inn fortløpende til en kort første prat med deg om hva du er interessert i og dine tanker rundt det å være konsulent. Etter det er det en kort fagprat med noen av lederne våre som baserer seg på hva du kan og vil lære mer om. Vi bruker tester i prosessen fra AlvaLabs som går på hva slags personprofil du er og hvordan du resonnerer. Etter det tar vi en samlet vurdering av prosessen. Det høres kanskje litt omfattende ut, men vi ønsker å ha ulike profiler som også jobber godt sammen. Vi får alltid god feedback av studentene om at dette er det beste teamet de har jobbet i; Da bruker vi heller litt ekstra tid i prosessen. "

Production Supervisor (Relocate to Malta),Magro Brothers · Norway  1 week ago  · 26 applicants,"About the job
Magro Brothers Group of Companies is a private, family-owned organisation. It finds its roots in 1916 when three Magro brothers joined their father`s business as general provisions merchants.

In 1934 they ventured in the processing and canning of fresh tomatoes and subsequently branched into a number of other business activities including the importation into Malta of livestock, fodder and foodstuffs and exports of local agricultural produce.

In 1977, John and Michael Magro, the sons of one of the first partners, took over the running of the business and further expanded their activities to include tinplate can manufacture, food distribution, retailing, advertising & marketing, property development.

In 1995, the company moved to a purposely built factory with a covered area of 27,000 square metres which today has become a centre of excellence for food processing in the Mediterranean.

In December 2013, John and Michael, being the 3rd generation in the Magro Brothers business enterprise, transferred their shares to John’s children namely, Christian, Nicholas and Joanna. Christian was appointed C.E.O. of the Group in January 2018 while John remains chairman of the Group and Michael continues to form part of the main board of directors.

The backbone of the food sector of Magro Brothers Group of Companies is still the processing of fresh tomatoes – Magro Brothers (Foods) Ltd is the major company within the group. It is one of the few local companies which handle the whole production cycle of tomato related products, from the growing of crops to the distribution of the finished product. This also includes the production of tinplate-cans. The present production range is very diversified and includes canned tomatoes, table and pasta sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise and other condiments, thin sauces, jams and ready-to-eat jellies.

The company is also well established in several overseas markets with sales offices in UK and Ireland supplying high profile international brands. Presently the company exports some 45% of its production to 20 countries spread in four continents.

In 2004, as part of the company’s policy of diversification and living up to market expectations, Magro Brothers Group expanded their business to offer exclusive gifting and hampers of Maltese delicacies and crafts under the Savina Brand and, in 2010 they ventured also in the production of traditional Maltese cheeses and dairy products under the popular Hanini Brand.

Today, with over 100 years’ experience, Magro Brothers Group of Companies has become one of the leading enterprises in Malta and has gained the respect of the local business community and the trust of most financial and commercial organisations. The owners take pride into rigorously monitoring the crops and herds of the many Maltese and Gozitan farmers who regularly supply fresh agricultural produce and milk to their organisation. This has helped the company to achieve the well-deserved premier position in food processing in Malta.

The company is very proud of its Quality credentials and boasts a BRC Grade AA food safety certification, an Organic certification and ISO 22000. They offer brand owners a wealth of manufacturing expertise and specialize in private label. Currently they supply their products to various multinational brand owners around the world and in major retail outlets.

About Enode

Do you want to join a fast-growing climate tech startup with real impact?

At Enode, our mission is to accelerate the energy transition 🌍️

A fully renewable energy system is dependent on flexible demand that can adapt to the intermittent supply from wind and solar. To create this flexibility, we need to connect to and control the fast-growing demand coming from electric vehicles, heat pumps and other energy hardware.

This is what we’re doing at Enode. Our APIs power the next generation of green energy apps, reaching more than 60 million consumers worldwide.

We are backed by some of the best climate tech investors in the world, including Y Combinator, Lowercarbon Capital and Creandum. We already have a global presence with customers in 11 countries across Europe, US and APAC.

You are a people's person who can engage with customers and understand their needs. You are organized and used to handling a large number of high stakes relationships, and moving them forward.

You should be ready to get your hands dirty and not expect someone else to fix menial tasks for you - you are a builder, motivated to build a potentially generational climate tech business from the ground up.

Competitive compensation, including a very attractive employee option program
A remote-first setup. We also have an office in Oslo if you want to work from there
Stipend for setting up your home office / co-working space
Regular offsites with the team in various exciting locations (we went to Italy 🇮🇹 earlier this year).

About The Job

The Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering (IHB) at NTNU has a vacancy for a PhD candidate within the topic of modelling and advanced control in demanding marine operations.

The digital agenda is one of the pillars of the European Strategy for Growth, which proposes to better exploit the potential of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in order to foster innovation, economic growth and progress. It lists “marine operation” as one of the main areas through which to achieve growth. In marine system and transport, digitalisation can significantly improve design, operation, and management through more accurate information on operational and infrastructure conditions and on the location of vehicles and/or system behaviour models. Better access to and sharing of digital data (traffic, travel, vehicle, cargo etc.) for both public and private stakeholders could open up a wide range of new opportunities toward digital marine operations. Modelling, sensor fusion and advanced control are considered in this study, with a focus on different levels of autonomy for demanding marine operations, ranging from being completely controlled by human, i.e., tele-operated, to being fully autonomous and without any interaction from human.

The project will collaborate closely with key industry players and has ambition to utilize full-scale closed-loop experiments utilizing state-of-the-art infrastructure. Examples of relevant topics include sensor fusion of cameras, radar and maps, situational awareness, trajectory planning with collision avoidance, automated docking, control design for the whole operational domain, control allocation, etc.

VI HAR ROM FOR DEG

Housekeeping – stolthet i å gi fine opplevelser

Hver dag arbeider våre ansatte/medarbeidere sammen for å kunne stelle i stand gode opplevelser på våre hoteller. En av de mange familiene som har vært gjester hos oss ble møtt av en hyggelig overraskelse da de kom tilbake til rommet sitt. Bamsene til en liten jente var satt til å gjøre ulike aktiviteter rundt om i rommet; en som leste bok, en annen som slappet av under dynen med fjernkontrollen i hånden. En flott historie skapt av en av våre housekeepers/renholdsmedarbeidere for å gi våre gjester noe å smile av.

Dine Arbeidsoppgaver Som Housekeeper

Rengjøre værelser og fellesområder slik at hotellet vårt skinner
Sørge for at housekeeping-/renholdsavdelingen sitt utstyrslager fylles
Ta hånd om gjestenes gjenglemte gjenstander
Levere god service med et personlig aspekt, samt hilse gjestene når man treffes
Opplæring av studenter og nye kollegaer

Vi bryr oss stort om å ta vare på mennesker og kloden vår, og vi har tillitt til at våre medarbeidere utgjør en viktig forskjell. Det ser ut til at våre housekeeping-/renholdsavdelinger er ledende på dette området. Idéen om å legge skitne håndklær på gulvet ble til i en av våre housekeeping-/renholdsavdelinger. I dag er denne praksisen standard rutine på hoteller over hele verden.

Kvalifikasjoner

Du har erfaring med renhold fra hotell eller tilsvarende.
Du kan gjøre deg selv forstått på enten engelsk, norsk, svensk eller dansk.
Du har interesse og forståelse for et bredt spekter av kulturer.

Dette er en midlertidig ansettelse som ekstrahjelp. Din nærmeste leder er Trude Hammergren, hotellsjef. Stillingen inkluderer dagskift i både ukedager og helger. Startdato vil være så snart som mulig."
Forskningstekniker,"UiT- The Arctic University of Norway · Tromsø, Troms og Finnmark, Norway  2 weeks ago  · 6 applicants","About the job
Om stillingen

Ved Avdeling for komparativ medisin (AKM) er det ledig en 100% fast stilling som forskningstekniker. Det er ønskelig med snarlig tiltredelse i stillingen.

AKM er en kjernefasilitet ved Det helsevitenskapelige fakultet (Helsefak). Avdelingen er en forsøksdyravdeling for oppstalling og bruk av laboratoriedyr (mus, rotter, sebrafisk og gris) i biomedisinsk forskning. AKM har syv ansatte og har de siste årene gjennomgått omfattende utbygging og modernisering og er nå framtidsrettet, velutstyrt og med gode arealer. Enheten driftes med høyt fokus på etisk og dyrevelferdsmessig forsvarlig bruk av dyr i medisinsk forskning.

AKM benyttes av forskningsgrupper ved Helsefak innenfor preklinisk biomedisinsk forskning på kreft, stamceller, neurovitenskap, hjerte- og karsykdommer, infeksjonssykdommer, metabolske og autoimmune sykdommer. AKM betjener også biomedisinske forskningsgrupper fra andre fakultet på UIT, samt eksterne samarbeidspartnere som UNN, forskningsinstitutter og bioteknologifirma i Tromsø-regionen.

Arbeidssted er UiT i Tromsø.

Arbeidsoppgaver

Den ansatte skal delta i den daglige drift av avdelingen og primære arbeidsoppgaver omfatter:

Daglig stell og tilsyn av forsøksdyr
Bistand og teknisk assistanse ved forsøk
Journalføring og dokumentasjonsarbeid
Orden, rydding, vask og desinfeksjon av utstyr
Helgevakt og beredskapsvakt (telefonvakt) hver 4-5 uke (honoreres etter egen særavtale)

Da avdelingen er under betydelig utvikling, og vi ivaretar mange ulike funksjoner og dyrearter vil det for egnet søker være mulig å ivareta andre spesialfunksjoner i avdelingen.

E-post: amalie.h.andersen@uit.no

Det vil legges stor vekt på at søker har forsøksdyrskurs i henhold til regelverkets kompetansekrav til personell som jobber med forsøksdyr og erfaring med de dyrearter som oppstalles på AKM (mus, rotte, sebrafisk og gris). Søker bør også ha generell IT-kompetanse, da journalføring må kunne gjøres elektronisk i tillegg til at en del administrative oppgaver må forventes.

Arbeidet er allsidig, men kan være fysisk krevende, og krever derfor normal fysisk form. Den som ansettes kan ikke være allergisk mot dyr, kjemikalier eller planter eller ha økt risiko for å utvikle allergi.

Vi Ønsker Oss En Medarbeider Som Er Ansvarsbevisst Med Interesse For Dyr Og Forskning. Viktige Personlige Egenskaper Som Vil Bli Vektlagt Er

Evne til å jobbe selvstendig og ta initiativ

Embedded Linux Software Engineer,"Canonical · Oslo, Oslo, Norway  3 days ago  · 3 applicants","About the job
This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.

We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.

Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.

These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu – desktop or server – is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the world's most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.

But while classic, 'deb' based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know *exactly* what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.

We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.

These roles include:

Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)

At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.

Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.

What your day will look like

Based on the first round of interviews we identify specific teams where you might be an excellent fit, and conduct second round interviews with those teams. Our engineers:

Work with the latest Linux kernel, RTOS, and open source technologies
Deliver Ubuntu for the latest IoT and server-class hardware platforms
Integrate and maintain device-oriented software stacks
Write high-quality, well-designed software
Collaborate proactively with other globally distributed teams 
Display technical leadership internally and within our external communities 
Help our customers ship their apps and SDKs on Ubuntu
Build device OS images with Ubuntu Core, Desktop and Server
Optimise the Ubuntu kernel and libraries for silicon-specific capabilities 
Debug issues and produce high-quality code to fix them 
Contribute to technical documentation to make it the best of its kind 
Discuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions 
Participate as technical lead on complex customer engagements involving complete system architectures from cloud to edge 
Work usually from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks for company events 

What we are looking for in you

An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
Passion for embedded systems software (e.g. kernel, graphics, Yocto, RTOS) 
Fluency in at least one of Golang, C, C++, or Rust 
Professional written and spoken English 
Experience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) 
Excellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability 
Passion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation 
Excellent communication and presentation skills 
Result-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments 
Ability to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each

Additional Skills That You Might Also Bring

Experience with Debian/Ubuntu or other distro packaging 
Understanding of build systems and toolchains, including for cross-compilation 
Experience with firmware, uboot, UEFI, ACPI, DSDT, or boot loaders
Experience with power management on PCI ASPM, SATA ALPM, low power profiles 
Computer architecture knowledge of x86, ARM, RISC-V 
Experience in board design, bring up, and validation 
Experience with electrical engineering design tools (e.g. schematic capture, layout) 
Familiarity with Ubuntu development model
Performance engineering and security experience 
Shell or Python scripting skills 

What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person

Product

Nango simplifies the process for engineers to integrate their software with external APIs. Our open-source platform acts as a one-stop solution for all product integrations.

Despite companies investing $2B annually in creating product integrations, they often miss out on significant revenue due to the absence of crucial integrations. With Nango, businesses can integrate once and immediately tap into a suite of 120+ integrations. This not only saves on engineering expenses but also captures more opportunities and wins deals.

There's a growing trend towards enhancing software products with integrations, especially among LLM apps that require data imports from external systems."

About The Job

For a position as a PhD Candidate, the goal is a completed doctoral education up to an obtained doctoral degree.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important tool for sustainable decision-making. In the last decades, there was large progress in terms of the number, complexity and accuracy of impact categories covered; especially for those related to ecosystem quality. However, there are still some gaps. This includes impacts of noise and artificial lights on biodiversity that are not yet covered on a global level. This PhD will therefore aim to develop models for quantifying the impacts of noise pollution and artificial light on biodiversity (terrestrial, marine and/or freshwater) within the framework of LCA.

IndEcol is a pioneer in the development and application of industrial ecology methods, as well as the use of large data sets and scientific computing in industrial ecology. We focus on understanding resource use and environmental pollution associated with human activities, assessing the environmental aspects of different technologies and modeling society’s use of materials. IndEcol combines world-class competence in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Input-Output analysis (I/O), and Material Flow Analysis (MFA) with scientists’ contribution to IPCC and IPBES assessment reports, the International Resource Panel, active participation to the Life-Cycle Initiative hosted by UN Environment, and numerous publications featured in high-ranked journals. IndEcol hosts its own International MSc program and contributes to NTNU’s engineering education.

Engineering Manager,"Canonical · Oslo, Oslo, Norway  1 day ago  · 2 applicants","About the job
This is a general track for first-level engineering management positions at Canonical.

We believe that open source is just starting to transform the tech sector and enterprise compute. Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of 'most software to most companies'. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.

We believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team's direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.

A typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.

An Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.

We have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including:

Python and Golang
C / C++ / Rust
Data infrastructure
HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / React
Flutter
Distro packaging and systems
SAAS and web microservices
Kernel
Servers
Graphics, Browser and Desktop 
Silicon enablement and embedded devices
Product Security

If your domain of expertise isn't listed above, yet you feel it's relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway. We will route you to the most suitable team.

What we're looking for in you

An exceptional academic track record from both high school and university
Undergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path
Drive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations
Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English
A love of developing and growing people and a track record of it
Experience in leading, coaching and mentoring software developers

Firmware Engineer,"Tibber · Førde, Vestland, Norway  1 month ago  · 25 applicants","About the job
Tibber is the first fully digital energy company in the world. We are also the only energy company with the mission to reduce the residential energy consumption in Europe by 20%, and let all homes use energy in a sustainable way. We are constantly challenging the dinosaurs in the market by use of new technology and fresh ideas. 
We have tens of thousands connected electric cars, heat pumps and smart home devices that the Tibber platform controls for our customers in order to optimize, and reduce their consumption and cost. We not only believe that we’re the digital energy company of the future, we are the energy company of today.
 
What the role entails 
 Tibber works in the area of IoT and we produce some of our own hardware from scratch which is what you would get to do here. One of our most appreciated products in this area is Tibber Pulse which can be used as a complement to the Tibber app. This lets you track your electricity usage in real-time, and tells you what you can do to lower it, which benefits the environment as well as your wallet. You will be building firmware in products like Pulse and Homevolt, using languages such as C, C++, and Python and you will program in RTOS frameworks for ESP32 and Silicon Labs. In other words, this position offers you to get deeper into the exciting field of IoT.

This is you! 
You wish to thrive with us as a team, as well as in your work role. We believe that you’re truly passionate about firmware development, IoT, and doing something for a greater cause. You have already worked several years with development and you're experienced in embedded languages, for example, C and C++, and you have preferably professional experience with RTOS. 

As a person, you're self-going, communicative, and not afraid to speak your mind. The team you would belong to is small and your opinions will matter and be highly appreciated. We consider it meritorious if you have experience from a startup environment, and if you're already familiar with our product.
Tibber Culture
The Tibber team is growing in a fast pace! Our offices are located in Stockholm, Helsinki, Berlin and Førde. For us it is not an issue being in different workspaces physically, we are always connected through live streaming screens. Annually though, we do gather the work force physically doing a pop-up office – to work, explore a new city and spend time together. 
We work passionately with sustainability and a circular approach, both with our own products and in the entire ecosystem that is affected with everything we do.
Aside from making the world a better place within serious matters as green energy and sustainability, we are playful as well! Take a closer look at our own product Tibber Pulse, and you’ll find both Han Solo, Chewbacca and our names on the PCB. We know, it might be looked upon as both nerdy and cheesy – but we love it! We have a  “no shoe” policy at the office which enhance the feeling of coming home, but also result in a great opportunity when it comes to showing off your slipper fashion range. We believe creative people work better without shoes. The well known facts that all people are different, and far from everyone is a morning person – are the very reasons why we work with flexible work hours. 
We are very proud of being a mission driven startup with thousands and thousands of new users every month. The majority of our investors are proudly represented by Tibber employees, Silicon Valley based Founders Fund, the entrepreneur Petter Stordalen – and more. 
Join our Tibber Tribe, it will be an adventure!

Data Hunter hos Digital Tvilling AS,"Digital Tvilling · Bergen, Vestland, Norway  3 months ago  · 2 applicants","About the job
Vil du være med å bygge fremtidens grønne verdikjeder?

En forutsetning for å lykkes med det grønne skiftet er høy grad av samarbeid mellom mennesker, på tvers av selskaper.

Vi er en innovasjon og plattformleverandør som bygger kollektiv intelligens for komplekse utfordringer. Sammen med søsterselskapet vårt i Sverige, har vi erfaring fra samfunnsbærende verdikjeder som tungindustri, helse, infrastruktur og matvareproduksjon.

Vi bygger digitale representasjoner av komplekse systemer som ser ut og oppfører seg som virkeligheten. Dette kan være transportsystemer, energisystemer eller biologiske systemer. Eller noe helt annet.

Vi tror på en datadreven verden, men først og fremst tror vi på mennesker som tør å ha det gøy på jobb!

Nå ser vi etter deg som ønsker å jobbe som Data Hunter.

I Digital Tvilling bruker vi begrepet Data Hunter eller datajeger om en rolle som spenner over både salgsaktiviteter, case-arbeid og prosjektplanlegging. Datajegeren har i oppgave å lokalisere, samle og gjøre tilgjengelig data (og datakilder) som trengs for å utføre analyser, scope-løsninger, bygge representasjoner, lage visulaiseringer etc - kort sagt for å levere vårt kjerneprodukt. Stort sett vil datajegeren være engasjert i å koordinere innsatsen og finne data som ikke er lett tilgjengelig.

Aktiviteten til datajakt har fire fasetter: digital antropologi, systemteknologi, syntese og koordinering.

Digital antropologi refererer til den «menneskelige» siden av å finne data og kan innebære intervjuer, feltarbeid og nettverksbygging. «Hvem vet hvilke data vi trenger?», «hvem eier disse dataene?», «hva er historien bak denne måten å håndtere dataene på?».

Den systemtekniske delen handler om å forstå datakvalitet, datasystemer, formater etc. kort sagt de tekniske aspektene ved dataene som trengs for den spesifikke saken eller prosjektet. «Er dette riktig type data?», «hvordan er dataene strukturert?», «finnes det et API for dataene?».

Syntese er kombinasjonen av innsikt fra arbeid med systemteknologi og digital antropologi som er samlet inn fra datajakten. Dette kan være avgjørende innsikt for teknisk team, nemlig team, løsningsarkitekt eller sakseier, og datajegeren forventes å dele og gi mening om funn gjennom ethvert tilfelle eller prosjekt. «Hvordan er dette viktig for saken?», «Er disse dataene pålitelige?», «stemmer disse dataene med virksomheten?».

Den siste fasetten av koordinering handler om å holde sammen innsatsen og veilede partnere eller andre i deres søken. «Fikk vi dataene vi trenger fra org X?», «Når får vi eksporten av de nødvendige dataene».

Vi ser etter deg som er nysgjerrig på mennesker, liker komplekse problemstillinger og som er glad i data. Du har gjerne analytiske evner og en interesse for hvordan mikroperspektivet henger sammen med det større bildet. Vi liker å snakke om evnen til å zoome inn og ut, den er unik og ekstremt viktig for å kunne håndtere komplekse verdikjeder som vi jobber med.

Vi tilbyr en spennende og variert hverdag, gøye kolleger og frihet i hvor, når og hvordan du gjør arbeidet ditt. Vi er en relativt liten bedrift med raske beslutningsprosesser, men med store kunder både i privat og offentlig sektor.

Arbeidet foregår med Bergen som base.

Vi er fleksible som arbeidsgiver og stiller med kontor hvis du ønsker det, men vi tror også på å jobbe remote under de rette forholdene. Vi har kontorer i Bergen og Stockholm. Vi søker både fast ansatte, deltidsansatte, prosjektmedarbeidere eller timeansatte – svar i søknaden. Vi verdsetter resultater mer enn tid på kontoret. Noen reiser kan forekomme innenfor tjenesten."

PhD Candidate in Stability and control of large offshore wind power plants,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) · Trondheim, Trøndelag, Norway  3 weeks ago  · 1 applicant","About the job
About The Job

With the European Union setting the ambitious goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, and many other countries embracing similar policies to decarbonize electricity, supporting a more sustainable society, there is a significant need for technological advances and increased competitiveness to drive the growth of offshore renewable energies, and energy storage in the coming years.

Within this context, this PhD project will focus specifically on investigating how to ensure that large amounts of offshore wind energy can be integrated into the electric grid without jeopardizing its stability due to resonance phenomena and harmonic interactions.

The PhD Candidate will be employed at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and the workplace will be in Trondheim, Norway, but the PhD-project is of both academic and industrial relevance, and it will therefore be developed in close cooperation between NTNU in Trondheim and the company Petronas , which is a global Malaysian energy group.

Your immediate leader is the Head of Department.

Duties of the position

The objective of the PhD education is to qualify for scientific research of high international standard. The PhD education has a nominal duration of three years of full-time study and includes required coursework or similar academic training comprising a minimum of 30 credits. The most important component of the PhD education is an independent scientific research project carried out under academic supervision, which results in the PhD thesis. The PhD degree is conferred based on these two elements and the doctoral examination, which consists of a trial lecture and a public defense of the scientific thesis.

In the scientific research project, the PhD candidate will investigate the risks in terms of harmonic resonances/harmonic instability which may arise from the increase in power level and distance from shore of wind turbines (as well as PV farms) with ac collection systems, and how they depend on the operating conditions of the farm.

Among the specific objectives of the PhD project there are:

To identify a realistic use-case (baseline case) for a large offshore wind park (or possibly PV plant) with ac collection grid.
To model the identified test case in MATLAB or DIgSILENT to replicate the problem, in such a way that it is possible to parameterize turbine type (Type 3 or Type 4) or PV, network with varying grid strength, short circuit ratio, etc. 
Validate various operating modes of the wind farm (e.g., constant PQ mode, voltage/frequency support mode or grid forming mode) against the baseline test case.
Capture harmonic resonance and stability issues depending on number of wind turbines (or PV panels) in operation, wind speed (or solar irradiation), cable length, converter topology and control, etc. both theoretically and by simulations.
Identify critical parameters for resonance/instability.

I Rikstoto drømmer vi om å skape engasjerende hestespill til alle – hvor vårt viktige samfunnsoppdrag er å sikre ansvarlig pengespill på hest, med overskudd som går tilbake til hestesporten.

Årlig har vi nesten 200 000 kunder som enten spiller aktivt eller fra tid til annen synes det er spennende å spille på hest. Vårt oppdrag er å tilby attraktive spill, sørge for engasjerende kundeopplevelser, og sørge for at alt skjer innenfor trygge rammer for spillerne.

Nå søker vi flere utviklere som kan bli del av vårt in-house utviklingsteam hos Norsk Rikstoto, hvor du som frontend-utvikler kan være med på å utvikle virksomhetskritiske systemer og tjenester i et spennende marked. Vi har opprettet et eget område i Rikstoto, Produkter og Tjenester, som samler alle innen produkt, design og utvikling til å skape team og ta ansvar i fellesskap for kundereisen. Sammen med erfarne kolleger vil du spille en sentral rolle i ulike produktteam og bidra til å forbedre våre produkter og skape engasjement.

Her vil du ikke bare jobbe side om side med erfarne utviklere, dyktige UX-designere og dedikerte produktledere, men også få sjansen til å utvikle og drifte våre tjenester med stadig utvikling av spillprodukter som spilles 24/7. Vi leverer våre spillprodukter på tvers av web, mobil, retail og TV, og hver dag er en spennende utfordring. Du vil ha betydelig innflytelse på din egen arbeidshverdag og spille en sentral rolle i spennende prosjekter som vil forbedre produktene våre i årene som kommer. Enten om du har kortere eller lengre erfaring, kan vi tilby spennende og utfordrende muligheter innenfor frontend utvikling.

Arbeidsoppgaver

Arbeidsoppgavene i rollen som utvikler hos oss vil være varierte. Vi jobber med nyutvikling og kontinuerlig forbedring av eksisterende løsninger, hvor rett kandidat vil være en fagressurs som involveres tidlig i designprosessen.

I enkelte av våre tjenester er det for eksempel mye data som skal inn på små flater – en spennende nøtt å knekke! Videre ønsker vi noen som tar eierskap på klientsidekode for webbaserte tjenester, og som aktivt deltar i diskusjoner og utviklingsoppgaver i teamet. Rammeverk, verktøy og metodikk er stadig i bevegelse og her vil du kunne påvirke veien videre. I dag er verktøy som Storybook, Chromatic og Cypress ting vi liker. Er du interessert og motivert for å gå inn i en Tech Lead rolle, vil det for rett kandidat være muligheter til dette.

Kvalifikasjoner

Postdoc within Simulation-Based Testing with Automatic Scenario Generation and Adaptation,"Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) · Trondheim, Trøndelag, Norway  1 month ago  · 8 applicants","About the job
About The Job

We are seeking a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to join our team for a two-year fellowship position. The primary objective of this position is to qualify for senior academic roles while contributing to the project ""SIMPLEX: The role of simulation in assurance of intelligent and complex systems"". This collaborative initiative involves DNV, Zeabuz, and NTNU, and focuses on the development of a comprehensive framework for simulation-based testing of autonomous systems.

The need for new sustainable modes of urban transportation is driven by factors such as growing coastal cities, congested roads, increased demand for personal mobility, the establishment of zero-emission zones in urban areas, and the general public's call for sustainable transport solutions. To address this, one promising solution is the utilization of urban waterways for small and medium-sized electric passenger ferries. However, realizing the potential benefits of these ferries hinges on reducing or eliminating the need for on-board manning. Despite the rapid development of technology for autonomous passenger ferries, the lack of trust in their safety remains a primary obstacle to their widespread deployment.

The main goal of the SIMPLEX project is to address this challenge by developing a framework for holistic simulation-based testing of autonomous systems that will help build the trust needed to deploy the systems into society.

The postdoc's role in the project will be to contribute to this framework by focusing on the development of methods and tools for automatic simulation-based testing. This includes the building and automatic adaptation of relevant scenarios, developing ways of ensuring sufficient scenario exploration and coverage, and research how to evaluate test outcome automatically in an efficient manner. The candidate will also contribute towards testing the developed tools and methods on real-world use cases focused on urban passenger ferry systems.

You will work within an interesting research project, benefiting from cooperation with highly engaged and diverse industrial partners. The main supervisor is Associate Professor Børge Rokseth who has a background in system modelling and simulation, system safety assessment and system assurance. The immediate leader is Prof. Sebastien Gros, Head of Dept. of Cybernetics.

Duties of the position

Develop and Refine Framework: Develop and refine a comprehensive framework that combines safety requirements and automatic testing of autonomous systems. This includes designing methodologies, algorithms, and tools to ensure that safety requirements are met and to identify any potential weaknesses in the system. Focus on creating innovative approaches for scenario generation and exploration, ensuring a wide range of test scenarios are covered to thoroughly evaluate the performance and safety of autonomous systems.
Collaborative Work: Collaborate closely with DNV and Zeabuz to understand their requirements, develop relevant tools and methodologies, and integrate them into their work processes and simulators, ensuring practical applicability and industry relevance.
Use Case Demonstrations: Collaborate with the project team to demonstrate the developed framework on specific use cases within the SIMPLEX project. This involves selecting appropriate scenarios, executing simulations, and analyzing the results to validate the capabilities of the testing framework.
Publication and Dissemination: Actively publish research findings in reputable scientific journals and present at relevant conferences to contribute to the academic community's knowledge in the field. Ensure effective dissemination of research outcomes and insights to research partners within the SIMPLEX consortium, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.
Supervision and Mentoring: Assist in supervising and mentoring master students involved in the project. Provide guidance, support, and technical expertise to ensure their successful contribution to the research objectives.
Continuous Learning and Professional Development: Stay updated on the latest advancements in autonomous systems, simulation techniques, and safety assurance methods. Engage in professional development activities, attend relevant workshops or training, and actively participate in discussions and forums related to the field.

Required Selection Criteria

You must have completed a Norwegian doctoral degree or corresponding foreign doctoral degree recognized as equivalent to a Norwegian PhD, in a field relevant to the goals of this position, for example: formal verification, systems engineering, system modelling and simulation, control engineering, or computer science. If you can document that the PhD thesis has been submitted, your application can be assessed even if you have not yet defended your dissertation. Documentation of the obtained doctoral degree must be presented before you can take up the position.

The Trondheim Academy of Fine Art

is a dynamic, international, intensely collaborative, and cross-disciplinary research environment that aims to provide next-generation artists, researchers, and practitioners with the range of experience, skills, creative confidence, and theoretical insight to work across sectors.

Trondheim Academy of Fine Art enables and promotes an understanding of artistic research that is equivalent to scientific research and, at the same time, fully embedded in a University of Science and Technology. This unique constellation allows for novel alliances across academic fields to respond to the complexities of societal challenges and contribute to NTNU’s vision to create “Knowledge for a better world”.

Seven academic staff members, complemented with visiting professors, guest teachers, and researchers are contributing to the strong reputation of the department in artistic research on Norwegian, Scandinavian, and European level. Individual fellows and their supervisors, post-doctoral researchers, and professors are shaping and reshaping an artistic research environment focused on visual arts while also being genuinely open to artistic research emerging in the fields of design, architecture, film, and new media.

About The Job

Trondheim Academy of Fine Art seeks applicants with the verve to explore and to articulate arts and artists’ new potentials in today’s society. These positions require a high level of commitment to contributing to an artistic research environment that wish to revisit, revaluate, and reinvent key aspects of the relationships between art, technology, and society.

 Two positions will be part of the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) funded project “Climate Rights""

The “Climate Rights: Designing Visual Evidence for Climate Cases” project draws upon artistic research, architecture, environmental design, geospatial science, film-making and international law to critically interrogate the emerging spaces of rights-based climate cases and ecocide law. The project is interested in better understanding and intervening into how visual-spatial research can transform the way environmental damage and climate harm is presented towards opening new imaginaries for climate rights in Norway and internationally.

The two PhD’s will be part of the Climate Rights project team in developing artistic and practice-based research with strong social impact. Using geospatial visualizations and modelling combined with participatory methods, you will address evidentiary gaps in climate cases as a productive space for methodological experimentation and space for critical discourse by interrogating questions around responsibility, causality, and legibility.

 One position will be part of Trondheim Academy of Fine Art’s PhD program in Artistic Research

The broad context for this position is NTNU’s focus on the Ocean as a long-standing strategic research area. It will build upon the experiences of Trondheim Academy of Fine Art’s Art and Ocean pilot project in developing artistic and practice-led research projects that address the aesthetic, political and methodological challenges of representing the deep ocean.

Your immediate leader is Head of Department.

Duties of the position

Successful Applicants Will Develop Artistic Research Projects That Operate Within One Or Across More Than One Of The Following Contexts And Frameworks

Documenting and documentary research on how evidence is represented and contested in the emerging spaces of climate litigation
Undertaking in-depth research on case studies in legal processes in collaboration with the project’s academic and non-academic partner institutions, other civil society organizations and cultural institutions
Developing design-driven approaches on using environmental data to visualize the deep ocean and the seabed in the context of emerging extractive projects
Critical approaches to histories, and theories of environmental justice in the context of oceans as a frontier, ecosystem, polity, and a site of struggle and water rights

We seek applicants from visual arts, architecture, design and other related fields with a strong interest in environmental, spatial and interdisciplinary research. These may include, but are not limited to extractivism and green colonialism, architectural and media forensics, data-driven computational approaches to design, climate attribution, environment, human and more-than-human rights and the law, emerging digital technologies, visual culture and ecology, community work, and critical approaches to histories, and theories of environmental and climate justice.

Sommerro er et hus med spisesteder, barer, kulturscener, møtesteder, hotellrom og en stor velværeavdeling med Vestkantbadet som hjerte. Her har vi rom for jobb, fest og avkobling, for å samles og for å trekke seg tilbake. Bygget som på 1930-tallet var Oslo Lysverkers stolte hovedkvarter er fullt av historier og for lengst en institusjon på Solli plass. Målet med Sommerro har vært å ikke bare gi nytt liv til bygget, men å gi ny energi til hele byen.

På trappen til Sommerro står det «lys – kraft – varme» hugget i stein. Det er arven etter gamle Oslo Lysverker og verdiene vi tar med videre. Vi er allerede en stor familie som tror på magien i møtet mellom mennesker og på djevelen i detaljene. Sammen elsker vi store idéer, høye ambisjoner og bredt lagarbeid.
