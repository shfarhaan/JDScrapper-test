For 21 quarters in a row, we’ve been ranked as a leader in G2 Mobile Marketing, Personalization, Customer Data Platform, and Customer Journey Analytics Grids.

You will also contribute to building innovative products by advocating for partners by taking their feedback and sharing it with the Product team to improve processes and product offerings. Another important duty of yours will be meeting important SLAs like response time and the lead time for issue resolutions.

Strong communication skills in writing (English)
High sense of responsibility and accountability

Alternative Venture Building Internship - Malaysia,REAPRA PTE. LTD. · Malaysia  2 weeks ago  · 50 applicants,"About the job
At Reapra, we are pioneering a very different way of building ventures. We believe in taking our time with potential founders in developing their vision of solving long-term systemic problems and see their startups today as being the first step to creating a future industry for the betterment of future generations. The people come and their commitments to these problems come first and their short-term ideas are just icing on the cake. Because of this approach, the way we source potential founders - initially through deep self-discovery - and operate internally is unlike most companies or VC firms.

We encourage you to apply to Reapra’s very unique internship program if you are: (1) curious about participating in a fun and engaging self-discovery process to give some direction in your career path, (2) enthusiastic about the startup space, and (3) interested in co-creating completely new systems of sourcing and founder development.

This position might not be for you if you are prioritizing an internship opportunity that teaches technical skills or responsibilities in standard recruitment, VC deal sourcing, marketing or PR, or other corporate or VC responsibilities. We are creating something completely new in every process and project we start!

Your internship will start off with a 2-week workshop called Foundation Design where you will use a model of self-understanding as a personal blueprint to enhance your learning and work throughout the project tasks and think about your own career options in the future. After completion of Foundation Design, you will dive right into a very dynamic, fast-changing set of project-related tasks while building new types of Venture communities along the way.

Your role will look to challenge the norms of founder sourcing and employee recruitment. We're talking about creative approaches that go beyond the usual platforms for investment sourcing and HR recruitment. As an intern, you'll collaborate on crafting new marketing, PR, and community building methods to connect with potential founders and employees. Think unstructured social engagement, pioneering events, and new communication channels. Your contributions might also extend to content and marketing activities that gradually educate the market on our novel venture building approach and ultimately help responding candidates progress to being considered by our Investment Committee. Ultimately, you will be one of the first builders of a new ecosystem of founders who look to solve long-term problems. Unlike traditional companies or other VC firms, this role will not be confined to standard HR recruiting techniques or investment analysis.

Join us to embark on a journey where you will help us redefine the art of sourcing and venture creation!

Responsibilities:

Co-develop, execute and update new systems to increase quality of founder sourcing in and around Malaysia, and possibly other markets
Organize events and meetings involving potential candidates in and around Malaysia
Own and execute tasks to supplement new systems
Start and run your own communities with Reapra frameworks to increase awareness and generate interest in its approach to venture building
Co-develop or support PR, marketing, and other market outreach activities
Coordinate and co-create with the main team in Singapore as well as other stakeholders in the Reapra group

About us:

Reapra’s mission is to co-create new industries that have a positive impact on society, by integrating research and practice together. We do this through integrative, people-centric venture building – a new business creation process that connects the entrepreneur’s intrinsic motivation to a promising field that solves complex long-term issues in society. We invest in entrepreneurs with a ‘build-to-last’ mindset to develop market leaders over the long term.

Legal Disclaimer:

By submitting an application to Reapra, I consent to the collection, use and disclosure of my personal data by Reapra and its affiliates, service providers and agents for the purpose of processing my application. This includes, but is not limited to, contacting me, evaluating my suitability, and conducting background checks regarding my application. I further confirm that I have obtained the prior consent of the relevant third parties for the use and disclosure of their personal data for the purposes of my application with Reapra.

I acknowledge that in the course of Reapra handling the personal data, relevant personal data may be transferred outside of Singapore. I further acknowledge that in the event my application is unsuccessful and unless I inform Reapra otherwise, Reapra may retain my personal data for consideration for future opportunities with Reapra.

I declare that the particulars in this application are true in every aspect.

Requirements

Self-Understanding: Being in touch with how and why you operate in decision-making and actions is important. Self-awareness can contribute to greater learning and personal and team growth
Open to Creating Something New: Embrace the opportunity to be part of creating something novel and impactful versus just improving on market-relevant technical skills
Exploration and Learning: We value candidates with diverse interests and a desire for continuous exploration of various perspectives and domains, new ways of learning and ultimately, brave innovation. 
Passion for Startups and Entrepreneurship: We're seeking individuals who exude enthusiasm for the startup landscape. Your excitement will drive our innovative efforts in venture building
Effective Communication: Effective and confident communication is essential. This includes a very high level of empathy and listening especially when managing very personal information alongside business considerations.
Independence: The ability to work independently is crucial. You should be self-driven and capable of taking initiative
Adaptability: Be comfortable without set tasks and willing to contribute across various functions, from 'sourcing' to marketing to admin tasks
No Experience Required: No minimal experience needed in these fields. Beginners are very welcome. While this is not strictly an ""HR"" role, a background in coaching, marketing, business psychology or PR could provide an added perspective but is not necessary

Join us to embark on a journey where you'll redefine the art of sourcing and venture creation. Be a part of our team, and together, let's reshape the startup landscape.

Healthcare Technical Product Support Specialist (Malaysia),AnsibleHealth · Malaysia  2 days ago  · 67 applicants,"About the job
What is Ansible Health?

At Ansible Health, a diverse mix of clinicians, engineers, and healthcare executives share a common vision: transforming how healthcare is delivered for patients with chronic diseases, beginning with those dealing with chronic respiratory conditions. Our team is a collection of talent from prestigious medical institutions like Columbia, New York Presbyterian, Emory, Johns Hopkins, and technology powerhouses such as Google, Amazon, and DE Shaw & Co. This unique blend of skills allows us to merge cutting-edge technology and superior clinical knowledge to deliver personalized, efficient care at scale.

Our commitment to patients is unwavering. We believe that healthcare should be accessible, efficient, and patient-focused. Our ambition goes beyond typical industry practices or manipulating RAF scores; we are building a business with improving patient health outcomes at its heart. Currently operating across half a dozen states in the US and on a rapid growth trajectory, Ansible Health has established robust partnerships with top healthcare systems such as Sentara Health Systems, Carilion Clinic, and the University of Virginia (UVA). Having recently closed our series A funding in mid-2023 with prominent investors like Bessemer, First Round Capital, AlleyCorp, and Breyer Capital, our expansion is accelerating.

With Ansible Health, you are joining a transformation in healthcare delivery. This isn't just about observing changes in healthcare; it's about actively contributing to them. We are enthusiastic about the future we are constructing and extend an open invitation to join us on this journey. Together, we can reshape healthcare for the better.

The Job at a Glance

As a Technical Product Support Specialist, your primary responsibility is to provide patients with exceptional technical support for our products and services. You will conduct Tech Calls for non-tech-savvy patients in the USA, who are mainly older adults. These calls involve guiding them through using their Android tablet and verifying it in the backend through Samsung Knox, ensuring that the RPM devices are connected and transmitting accurate data, and assisting them in joining their appointments via Zoom meetings. Occasionally, patients may require additional help with the above-mentioned steps during their time in our program. In some instances, verifying data through Azure (Device Analytics and CosmosDB) may be necessary. These steps enable patients to manage their conditions holistically at home while allowing clinicians to provide remote care.

Furthermore, you will support our clinical team by helping them set up their equipment (monitor, laptop, camera, etc.) and ensuring they are prepared for their virtual appointments. They may also require assistance with athenahealth tasks such as modifying visits and checking in/out. Generally, you will handle Tech On-Call duties, which demand a solid understanding of our tech stack and products (i.e., Android Tablet, Zoom meetings and phone, Google Workspace). You should be capable of providing basic troubleshooting steps and assistance to remove obstacles for clinicians/support staff in their work.

Collaborating closely with our Engineering Team is also an essential aspect of your role to effectively escalate issues requiring broader coordination and resolution. GitLab and Azure DevOps are the primary ticketing systems used for filing issues and requests. Continuous follow-ups and monitoring are expected until the issue is resolved end-to-end. In addition, you are expected to present and take notes on meetings about issues encountered in Tech.

The ideal candidate should be comfortable navigating ambiguity due to the ever-evolving nature of our startup. To excel in this role, excellent problem-solving, communication, and organizational skills are essential.
