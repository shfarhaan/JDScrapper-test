SRE/Platform Engineer,Synthesia · EMEA  5 days ago  · 313 applicants,"About the job
👋 TL;DR: we're looking for experienced engineers to join our team and work with a strong focus on SRE, Platform Engineering and our Developer Experience.

Who are we?

On a mission to make video easy for anyone …

Synthesia is the world’s #1 AI video generation platform. Well, it’s actually a video production studio — in a browser, no cameras or film crews at all. You choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 120 languages, and your video is ready in minutes.

In Synthesia, you can build persoalised on-the-fly videos, give your chatbot a human face or run 24/7 weather channels in different languages, to name just a few of the possibilities.

We believe the future of media is synthetic, and we are on a mission to turn cameras into code and make everyone a creator.

Not sure what we’re talking about? Check out our intro video that explains what we’re doing and t his video for an overview of the role from one of our avatars.

Who are we hiring?

We’re looking for a seasoned engineer with a strong SRE or Platform Engineering focus to join our team support our product engineering teams.

Today we’re a small team who all get stuck in, but we’re structuring our work so that as we scale people have a natural alignment to a future team structure.

What does that really mean? When you join you’ll focus on a type of work (SRE, Platform Engineering or Developer Experience) with an 80/20 split on your area and everything else. We’re written about this recently on LinkedIn.

We are looking for people who have been though the scale-up process before. We’re a Product organisation of 50, having more than doubled in the last year. During that time we’ve close to 10x’d our transaction rate. We expect to see similar growth over the next few years.

We’re not just a SaaS product running high-volume CRUD type transactions, we also have long-running, resource intensive AI workloads, both training and inference, at scale. We work closely with teams in Product Engineering, AI R&D, MLOps and Security.

Key Responsibilities

As a member of the team you will…

Work with engineering teams to design, evolve and run high-volume, customer facing systems, both new and existing, including those which aren’t sticking to our golden path supported by Platform Engineering.
Deliver projects which expand the capabilities of our shared platform. This includes everything from Source Code management and Service Patterns, through Build and Deploy, right though Container Orchestration and finishes with our Metrics and Alerting systems. We aim to provide a Golden Path for Engineers that makes them happy, productive and efficient.
Being a member of our on-call rota, which may include working out of hours. We have a one week rotation, swapping on a Tuesday, managed by PagerDuty, with the team lead being available for escalation at all times and in the on-call rota themselves.
You will not have any direct reports, but will play a part in development and support of your peers. Your role could evolve into a Team Lead if that is the way you want to take it in the future.


We are looking for somebody who:

Has been though the Scale Up phase of a business (300 to 1000 employees or equivalent), seeing product and company numbers increase significantly, and someone who played a important role in making that successful.
Can self-manage and deliver multiple projects as part of a quarterly planning cycle within a team.
Is an excellent communicator and can partner with engineers to solve both structural/systemic problems and those which are time critical (live operations).
Can work with clarity when under pressure during operational incidents
Enjoys helping others achieve their goals though collaboration; DevOps is a culture not a team name (but yes, it’s our team name right now).
Has extensive experience running and debugging customer facing Production systems, in a SaaS environment, at scale.
Has extensive experience working with containers, orchestrators and autoscaling/self-healing/low operations systems.


We use a wide range of technologies, and we can’t all be experts in all of them, so if you don’t hit every box on this list, we’d still encourage you to apply.

Our Current Stack Includes

AWS: We have a strong focus on ECS today, but also have the AWS serverless stack (APIGateway, Lambda, Fargate) in our world. We’re very interested in people with strong Kubernetes experience (EKS).
Services built in Python and NodeJS.
TerraGrunt and Terraform for infrastructure as code.
A lot of GPUs. We’re very interested in the people with the intersection of CloudNative+GPU+High workloads.
MongoDB Atlas. We’re very interested in people with strong Mongo experience.
Github Actions for build and deploy tooling..
Git for version control.


At Synthesia we expect everyone to:

Be an owner.
Focus on outcomes over inputs and plans.
Make the journey fun
Default to simple. 


You can read more about this in this public Notion page: https://synthesia.notion.site/How-we-work-at-Synthesia-f794caa72f8446efb6be22b551ce0fa2

💸 A competitive salary + stock options in our fast growing Series C start-up.

📍 A remote-friendly environment. We expect occasional travel (1x per quarter) for quarterly planning/retrospectives to one of our European hubs. You're welcome to work out of our offices in London, Copenhagen, Munich, or Amsterdam, too.

🏝 25 days of annual leave + public holidays in the country where you are based.

🥳 Regular socials and company retreats.

🤩 4 weeks paid sabbatical after 4 years at the company + $10,000 USD.

👉 A generous referral scheme.

💻 A brand new computer of your choice and the equipment you need to get your work done

We are delighted to welcome applications for a research position investigating the changing dynamics of young adult’s living arrangements, including leaving and returning the parental home, house sharing and first partnership formation, within the ESRC funded ‘Connecting Generations’ programme.

Connecting Generations is a collaborative project between the long-established Centre for Population Change (University of Southampton, University of St Andrews, and University of Stirling), the University of Oxford Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, and the Resolution Foundation. Connecting Generations aims to innovate in knowledge and understanding of intergenerational relations and population change.

This project will examine trends in the timing of leaving the parental home and in the living arrangements of young adults, their explanations and policy implications. In particular, the post holder will consider the role of parental and other family resources in facilitating successful transitions in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the housing crisis and continuing economic uncertainty. A variety of data sources including individual level data from the England and Wales 2021 Census, UK Labour Force Survey, Millennium Cohort Study, and UK Gender and Generations Survey will be used.

This research position will be based in the Department of Social Statistics and Demography, within the Faculty of Social Sciences. You will work under the day-to-day direction of Professor Ann Berrington. You will be part of a supportive group including the Centre Research Manager, and other researchers working on similar themes, both within Southampton and partner institutions.

This research post is suitable for applicants who are about to finish, or have recently completed, a PhD in a quantitative social science discipline (or equivalent professional qualifications) and who have strong data analysis skills. The post holder should have proven experience of using large and complex individual level datasets, preferably including experience of analysing individual data from surveys such as the UK Labour Force Survey, UK Census Microdata, the British Cohort Studies, or the Gender and Generations Survey (any country). It is essential that the post holder already has a good knowledge of the sociological and demographic literature relating to the changing nature of transition to adulthood. Proficiency in the use of STATA; the ability to plan and organise work independently and as part of a team; and write research presentations and papers are also essential attributes.

Applications will be considered from candidates who are nearing completion of a PhD. The title of Research Fellow will be applied upon completion of PhD. Prior to the PhD qualification being awarded the title of Senior Research Assistant will be given.

The University of Southampton holds an Athena Swan Silver Award demonstrating commitment to equal opportunities in the workplace. We believe equality, diversity and inclusion are fundamental to making the University of Southampton a welcoming, vibrant and successful organisation. Having a diverse workforce, inclusive of people of all ages and beliefs, from different racial backgrounds, educational and social backgrounds opens up a wealth of possibilities, makes us more creative and accelerates our impact on society. We welcome applicants that value diversity of our community and are willing to play their part in supporting the mission of inclusivity.

Informal enquiries may be addressed to Prof. Ann Berrington, email: a.berrington@soton.ac.uk, telephone: +44 (0)23 8059 4549.

The post is available from 1 December 2023 with the latest start date being 1 March 2024."

""Working as part of the Night Stock team, we work behind the scenes, through the night doing the heavy lifting, to get the toys on the shelves! The customers don't see all the hard work we put in, breaking down pallets of deliveries and preparing stock to be taken out to the shop floor or stored in the stockroom. We're only a small team, and the time goes fast, but we get it all done when we work together... and having music on helps too! We price stock, we might sometimes change window displays and we most importantly, make sure the shelves are full ready for the next day of busy trade. I quite like being able to go home in the morning, and say hi to my family before they go off to work, and then get into bed to catch up on some sleep... ready for the next shift!"""

Psychology Graduate Primary Teaching Assistant

Do you hold a degree in psychology or a strongly related field – psychotherapy, counselling, special needs?

Do you have practical experience as well as theoretical knowledge of special educational needs and most importantly Autism?

Would you like to work in a Leicester primary school supporting pupils with additional needs?

Psychology Graduate TA/Teaching Assistant
Working with SEN primary pupils
Based in Smethwick B66
Full time, term time position
Autism experience ideally required

Smile Education are currently working with a number of primary schools in Leicestershire that need additional Teaching Assistants/Learning Support Assistants to work purely with pupils who need extra support and development in school. As with all schools there are a range of needs including social, emotional and physical. However, the main need is to work with pupils that are on the autistic spectrum.

Children and young people on the autism spectrum often need routine in order to help them understand the world around them. This means that they can find unstructured times such as lunch and break times particularly difficult.

They need longer to process information and can also find socialising and communicating challenging. Many want to make friends but find it hard as they lack the expected social skills. They are often bullied as their peers can lack autism awareness and acceptance.

The behaviour of some autistic children and young people can be challenging in school. This behaviour is often due to an underlying anxiety, frustration, or sensory sensitivity. Because of this our client schools require Teaching Assistants that are friendly, empathetic, and caring with the ability to form strong working relationships with pupils.

Good basic general education including GCSE (or) equivalent) in Maths and English at Grade C or above.
A Degree, or professional qualification, which is appropriate to the work.

The successful candidate will be required to obtain the appropriate prison clearance before starting the role and maintain this throughout employment.

Have you ever considered working... in a prison?

This is an excellent opportunity to educate and rehabilitate adult learners.

If you would like a unique and challenging non-teaching role, where you can genuinely make a difference, enhance the prospects of learners, and ultimately change people's lives for the better - then this could be the opportunity for you.

Like any educational setting, Prisons come with their challenges. In this environment, learners are locked up for large periods of the day, away from their families and for some, their children. Most are at rock bottom, having to live with the regret of what they have done - education gives them a focus. And hope.

Education provides prisoners with an opportunity to upskill, increasing their future employment prospects which directly reduces the likelihood of reoffending. Many prisoners will arrive without having basic Maths or English skills. Prison Education ensures all learners are put through Functional Skills Maths & English, which then puts them on the pathway to vocational learning courses, such as Carpentry, Bricklaying, Painting & Decorating, Plastering & Tiling, Industrial Cleaning, Barbering, Catering and Horticulture.

Prisons have a dedicated education department, with classrooms and fully functioning workshops, where teaching and learning can take place. You will be fully supported by an experienced education department. Training and development opportunities are available.

Job Advert

If you love footwear, fashion and people, Clarks is the place to be. As a Sales Team Member, you’ll be in the thick of the action, helping customers find shoes they’ll adore.

The role

In many ways, you’ll be the face of Clarks, welcoming people into your store. You’ll build a rapport with the customer by asking questions about what they want. Then you’ll give great advice to give reassurance and close the sale – maybe suggesting accessories when appropriate. In short, you’ll play an active role in every stage of the end-to-end selling process. With our first-class training, including coaching, observations and product knowledge, you’ll have what it takes to meet targets and performance standards and be the very best you can be. You will also find yourself playing an active role in keeping the store neat and tidy as well as lending a hand in the stockroom.

About You

Good with people and great in a team, you love dealing with customers. You’re never happier than when you’re on the shop floor, getting hands-on with sales. Your natural instinct for people means you know the right moment to make suggestions – and when to let customers make their decision.

An interest in fashion and footwear goes without saying. But it’s also important that you can promote Clarks. A brand ambassador, you champion our products and take pride in being part of a respected global name. Experience in a similar role would help, as would a flexible approach to hours.

About Clarks

Clarks, based in Somerset, England, has been at the forefront of innovative shoemaking since its foundation in 1825, when brothers James and Cyrus Clark made a slipper from sheepskin off-cuts. At the time it was ground-breaking; a combination of invention and craftsmanship that’s remained at the heart of what the brand does now.

In the Clarks archive of more than 22,000 pairs are shoes that have sparked revolutions and defined generations. From the original Clarks Desert Boot, first designed by Nathan Clark and launched in 1950 to the iconic Wallabee, each design has an instantly recognisable signature - a unique combination of craftsmanship and innovation that make it unmistakably Clarks.

Clarks is a global business operating retail, wholesale, franchise and online channels in over 100 markets worldwide supported by nearly 10,000 employees across the world.

The Benefits

As well as a rewarding career, development opportunities and a competitive salary, you’ll also enjoy a generous holiday allowance and the opportunity to join the company pension scheme.

We love hearing from great people

Clarks International believes that the principle of equality of opportunity is fundamental to the company's operations. Our long held aim is to provide just and fair treatment for all employees.
