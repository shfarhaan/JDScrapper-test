Data Analyst (part time),"AutoUncle · Århus, Middle Jutland, Denmark  5 days ago  · 281 applicants","About the job
About AutoUncle

At AutoUncle we are a company with dual visions.

Business Vision: Most people know us for our search engine — used by millions — to promote transparency in the used car market in Europe. Over time we have also used that underlying technology to build products that give price and market insights in lots of other contexts.

We want to make sure our platform is available wherever people need us, whether that is on our consumer search engine, in the hands of automotive professionals, via external marketplaces, or on dealer and OEM websites.

Company Vision: A great company culture depends on many factors. Having a compelling product. Building a strong community. Operating with trust and fairness. But before you can reach any of those goals, you need to relentlessly focus on people.

The Most Human Company is a place where people — each with individual and diverse abilities, ambitions, and emotions — come together to work, learn, and grow.

At AutoUncle, we acknowledge and appreciate that everyone has feelings and opinions, and we bring them to work with us every day. Our emotions can work for us or against us, but if we suppress them, we often end up blocking our own growth instead.

Humans are not machines. Input does not always equal output. That’s why we focus on outcomes — the results of hard work and creative energy — and not the time spent creating them. We know that success is a marathon, and we trust our teammates to know how to best use their time to reach our shared goals.

About The Data Analyst Opportunity & You

Your Role: 

As our Data Analyst, you will play an essential role in our data-focused initiatives. You'll adeptly handle diverse data sources, ensuring precision every step of the way. By diving deeply into datasets, you'll discover vital trends that shape our strategic approach. More than just numbers, you'll design visually engaging dashboards that transform complexity into easily understandable insights for everyone.

Your Credentials: 

Experience in data analysis, especially with tools like Excel, Python, R, and SQL, is essential. 
Strong data visualization know-how, preferably with Power BI, is a plus. 
Familiarity with quantitative methods, including cluster, regression, & factor analysis is beneficial. 
While a background in Cognitive Science, Business Intelligence, or Political Science is desired, but not a requirement. We also prioritize hands-on experience and skills.

About You: A team player by heart, you have an unwavering focus on detail. Owning projects and meeting deadlines come naturally to you. The ever-evolving nature of data excites you, and with your fluent English communication skills, you're adept at conveying insights. Expertise in automotive and/or automotive data is highly advantageous, as understanding the intricacies of car brands and models can offer a significant advantage.

Your Motivation: Your passion lies in analyzing automotive data. Curiosity drives you to spot the latest trends and there's a special place in your heart for creating user-friendly data visualizations."

As our engineering intern you will be working with embedded development of our Industrial IoT gateway, driving the 4th industrial revolution, enabling smart manufacturing, furthering sustainability of operations and improving reporting through agile data access.

Or if you couldn't decide to go for electronics or software because both are cool...

If you are itching to get to test out all the cool theory out there in the real world...

If you dream of working with a core pillar of Industry 4.0 – industrial data - and get experience with product development...

Then SIA Connect & Trifork is the place for you to be - and we need you!

Let's develop the future of Industrial IoT

We are on a journey of further modernising our C++ codebase, using test automation and refactoring best practices. So, if using the theory of good software practices in practice sounds cool, let's learn together.

Security, fuzzing and White-hatting

The ""S"" in IoT stands for Security; if you are interested in industrial hardening, fuzzing and security in embedded systems, we also have a task for you.

Your own idea

We embrace good ideas where ever they are from; if you have an idea that might fit, let's hear it.

About You
You are an Electronics or Software engineering student Your chosen field doesn't matter too much; what matters is that you are interested in working where the code meets the real world.
You love C++ We work in C++ with Qt as a framework, so experience with modern C++ is a plus.
You're at home in a varying environment New tasks and assignments pop up all the time; this gives us a quickly changing environment, with the possibility of learning from all kinds of new places.
If you have experience with Linux, it's an absolute plus Our system runs an embedded Linux platform, so you will fit right in if you are down with the command line.

Data Analyst (part time),"AutoUncle · Århus, Middle Jutland, Denmark  5 days ago  · 281 applicants","About the job
About AutoUncle

At AutoUncle we are a company with dual visions.

Business Vision: Most people know us for our search engine — used by millions — to promote transparency in the used car market in Europe. Over time we have also used that underlying technology to build products that give price and market insights in lots of other contexts.

We want to make sure our platform is available wherever people need us, whether that is on our consumer search engine, in the hands of automotive professionals, via external marketplaces, or on dealer and OEM websites.

Company Vision: A great company culture depends on many factors. Having a compelling product. Building a strong community. Operating with trust and fairness. But before you can reach any of those goals, you need to relentlessly focus on people.

The Most Human Company is a place where people — each with individual and diverse abilities, ambitions, and emotions — come together to work, learn, and grow.

At AutoUncle, we acknowledge and appreciate that everyone has feelings and opinions, and we bring them to work with us every day. Our emotions can work for us or against us, but if we suppress them, we often end up blocking our own growth instead.

Humans are not machines. Input does not always equal output. That’s why we focus on outcomes — the results of hard work and creative energy — and not the time spent creating them. We know that success is a marathon, and we trust our teammates to know how to best use their time to reach our shared goals.

About The Data Analyst Opportunity & You

Your Role: 

As our Data Analyst, you will play an essential role in our data-focused initiatives. You'll adeptly handle diverse data sources, ensuring precision every step of the way. By diving deeply into datasets, you'll discover vital trends that shape our strategic approach. More than just numbers, you'll design visually engaging dashboards that transform complexity into easily understandable insights for everyone.

Your Credentials: 

Experience in data analysis, especially with tools like Excel, Python, R, and SQL, is essential. 
Strong data visualization know-how, preferably with Power BI, is a plus. 
Familiarity with quantitative methods, including cluster, regression, & factor analysis is beneficial. 
While a background in Cognitive Science, Business Intelligence, or Political Science is desired, but not a requirement. We also prioritize hands-on experience and skills.

About You: A team player by heart, you have an unwavering focus on detail. Owning projects and meeting deadlines come naturally to you. The ever-evolving nature of data excites you, and with your fluent English communication skills, you're adept at conveying insights. Expertise in automotive and/or automotive data is highly advantageous, as understanding the intricacies of car brands and models can offer a significant advantage.

Your Motivation: Your passion lies in analyzing automotive data. Curiosity drives you to spot the latest trends and there's a special place in your heart for creating user-friendly data visualizations."

At SIA Connect we connect the world of industrial machines, energy meters and buildings with the world of databases and clouds. And we are looking for our next intern!

Could you be the perfect fit for us?

As our engineering intern you will be working with embedded development of our Industrial IoT gateway, driving the 4th industrial revolution, enabling smart manufacturing, furthering sustainability of operations and improving reporting through agile data access.

If you are the kind of person, who thinks both serial protocols and cloud automation is interesting...

Or if you couldn't decide to go for electronics or software because both are cool...

If you are itching to get to test out all the cool theory out there in the real world...

If you dream of working with a core pillar of Industry 4.0 – industrial data - and get experience with product development...

Then SIA Connect & Trifork is the place for you to be - and we need you!

Let's develop the future of Industrial IoT

In the internship, you will be helping develop the product towards the market's needs and have a strong focus on secure implementation. You will get a lot of hands-on knowledge with IoT applications and be involved in all the processes, from design specifications to implementation and testing.

Modern C++ and automation

We are on a journey of further modernising our C++ codebase, using test automation and refactoring best practices. So, if using the theory of good software practices in practice sounds cool, let's learn together.

Security, fuzzing and White-hatting

The ""S"" in IoT stands for Security; if you are interested in industrial hardening, fuzzing and security in embedded systems, we also have a task for you.

Your own idea

We embrace good ideas where ever they are from; if you have an idea that might fit, let's hear it.

About You
You are an Electronics or Software engineering student Your chosen field doesn't matter too much; what matters is that you are interested in working where the code meets the real world.
You love C++ We work in C++ with Qt as a framework, so experience with modern C++ is a plus.
You're at home in a varying environment New tasks and assignments pop up all the time; this gives us a quickly changing environment, with the possibility of learning from all kinds of new places.
If you have experience with Linux, it's an absolute plus Our system runs an embedded Linux platform, so you will fit right in if you are down with the command line.
About Us

In addition to joining an inspiring journey in a “start-up”, you will become a part of the Trifork family with many skilled colleagues with plenty of opportunities to work with them.

You will get plenty of opportunities to develop professionally in a very casual environment.

Our team consists of contrarian engineers with combined research, engineering, and leadership experience from Apple, ARC, ARM, Bell Labs, CMU, University of Cambridge, EPFL, IBM Research, Max Planck, MIT, and NEC Labs. Find out more at https://signaloid.com and try out the Signaloid uncertainty-tracking computing platform by signing up for free at https://get.signaloid.io.

A driven but respectful environment

Our motto is ""We're all going to die"": We never speak ill of others even if we differ in our viewpoints; we show up every day with a sense of urgency; we treat each other with respect as though each day were our last
No isolated ""projects"": No person in the team works in isolation and a successful outcome for the thread of work you lead will inherently depend on getting help from (and helping) other members of the team

Role Description

In this role, you will help expand Signaloid's application portfolio. You will:

Explore a wide range of application domains and for each domain identify important algorithms that can benefit from uncertainty tracking
Implement each identified algorithm in C, both as a standalone version and as a version that runs on [Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform](https://signaloid.io)
For each implemented algorithm, document the content concisely and publish them in GitHub
For each implemented algorithm, carry out and document a comparative performance quantification of Signaloid implementation against the standalone implementation
At each step, coordinate with the Applied Mathematics Lead to ensure alignment with company objectives and conventions

Within a year in this role, you can expect to:

Take on more responsibility in communicating created examples with customers
Contribute to the strategic direction of Signaloid by advising according to gained experience in application domains
Expand your role to encompass other areas in which you have demonstrated exceptional competence

Requirements

Minimum Required Skills and Experience:

Demonstrable research or publications in applied mathematics, sciences, or engineering
Demonstration of exceptional analytical abilities and quick comprehension of a new subject
Experience in programming in C/C++

Additional Desirable Skills and Experience:

A good understanding of probability theory, statistics, and Bayesian estimation
An understanding in the role of uncertainty in measurements and in engineered systems
Familiarity with Python

Benefits

A flexible remote-first work environment: Be part of an international team with the flexibility to choose where you live, as long as you are available during the working hours of 09:00 to 17:00 UK time
Join the rest of the team several times each year for an in-person session somewhere in Europe
Competitive compensation: Yearly bonus based on company's Objectives and Key Results (OKR) performance and bi-yearly bonus based on your project team's OKR performance
Simple transparent compensation across the company, with four pay levels, in all roles, based on skill level: Contributor, Senior Contributor, Lead Contributor, and Principal Contributor
All full-time employees receive attractive stock options package

Our Recruiting Procedure

All positions require you to write a one-page cover letter (you can also substitute the cover letter for a snippet of code that will run on the signaloid.io platform; be creative!). We use the cover letter to screen for communication skills, as clear communication is essential in a remote working environment
Applicants who pass the cover letter screening receive an initial 15-minute Zoom screening call with a member of our People Development Team to discuss your CV
Applicants who pass the screening interview, regardless of the position they are interviewing for, will be given a real-world project to solve over the course of one week (or two weeks if you are currently employed in a full-time job). In exchange for your time, we give you two books relevant to the rest of the interview process and £500 worth of free credits on the Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform
Applicants who successfully complete the project are invited for a set of 45-minute interviews with people from our core teams (there will be up to six such interviews) which will use the project you completed as a discussion point
In the final stage, applicants are invited for an on-site interview with members of the team in Cambridge, or a ""virtual onsite"" interview where a team from Signaloid will be at your disposal to implement a solution to a representative challenge you could face in the role"

Junior Software Engineer (Swedish) 🇸🇪

Join one of Denmarks fastest growing B2B startups and play a key role in scaling our data solutions across borders.

About Resights 🚀

So if you’ve found your way here, we assume you want to know more about our Junior Software Engineer opportunity right? And you are probably a student or just graduated? Very exciting! But first, maybe we should tell you more about what we do and more importantly, why!

People claim data is the new oil, so why is it soooo time consuming and complicated to work with? 🤯 Data should be accessible and easy to understand. And that is what we are here to do for the real estate industry. Buildings? Yes, buildings! Those that make up our cities and are an essential part of life, providing the places where we live, work, and relax. Our daily bread is to collect and visualize any type of data that is even remotely relevant to real estate - paving the way for much better decision making. No more gut feelings or spreadsheets 🥱

So, in a nutshell, that’s Resights. Or actually not, because what really defines us, are the +40 people behind our software. A collection of nerdy team players who in less than two years have built one of fastest growing startups in Denmark (yes that is true). All while we had fun, because that's truly a part of our DNA 🧬

Engineering at Resights 🤓

Let us take you inside the Engineering team at Resights.

We like to think of ourselves as sympathetic doers. By sympathetic doers, we mean being able to make serious progress super fast without sacrificing being human in the process. We laugh, we have fun, and we know what happens in each others’ lives.

The Engineering team is in close collaboration with our Product team. We actually see the two teams as one big team, sharing goals and responsibility. The Engineering team is 12 people strong, divided almost evenly between frontend and backend. Many different backgrounds, and many different nationalities and cultures. We are a team where all opinions are valued and listened to. Best idea wins, that’s how we like to go about it.

And now we are looking for a Junior Software Engineer to help us grow and ensure our product scales the next 10 years!

About You ⭐️

You’re Swedish speaking student or just graduated, and ready and motivated to learn what it takes to bring Resights solutions to your home-country! You want to work directly with the CTO and Co-Founder of Resights and learn the steps of what it takes to build a comprehensive data solution that aggregates and structures vast amounts of data. You currently have a passion for backend services, but are not hesitant to get your hands dirty in all kinds of areas – and most importantly, passionate about how to go from data to value-creation.

Past experience 🎓

Comfortable with Python programming language.
Native Swedish speaker living in Copenhagen.
Preferably some experience with AWS.
Knowledge of distributed version control, primarily Git.
Preferably some familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases (Postgres or ElasticSearch).
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.
Experience in communicating goals, priorities and projects in a comprehensible way.

You love 💙

Being part of a company with a true building culture. Ship fast, learn, ship again.
Striking the balance between speedy and comprehensive solutions, recognizing the appropriate situations for each.
Seeing code as a creative force to solve problems and you enjoy navigating through different potential solutions.
Working in close collaboration with backend, designers and product managers.
Details. Because you know that the devil is in the detail 😈
That the best argument wins, no matter who it comes from.
Learning. Because there is so much we don’t know. And usually a little bit of research gives you a pretty good idea. At least good enough to move the needle.
Asking for forgiveness rather than permission.
Other areas than purely code. You have a natural interest in what is best for the business.

Resights Tech Stack 💾

The frontend stack consists of Vue.js, NuxtJS and Typescript while backend consists of Python leveraging ElasticSearch, Postgres and Redis. Setup deployed in Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

Software Developer til Data Mining & Fraud Detection,"ATP · Hillerød, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 6 applicants","About the job
Har du styr på Python og SQL? Og vil du udvikle løsninger og værktøjer, der gør offentlige myndigheder i stand til at gennemføre koordinerede kontroller med en lang række velfærdsydelser? Så er du den Software Developer, vi søger til Data Mining & Fraud Detection. 
Vil du være med til at fremtidssikre velfærdssamfundet?
Data Mining & Fraud Detection er en del Digital Solution i ATP. Her interesserer vi os lidt mere for data end de fleste. Og særligt for, hvad data kan, når datakvaliteten er i top. Som Software Developer i Data Mining & Fraud Detection vil du derfor bidrage til at sikre en koordineret indsats ift. kontrol af fejludbetalinger og snyd med offentlige ydelser i landets største udbetalingshus.


Du får mulighed for at bringe din tekniske viden i spil, når du hjælper med at udvikle modeller og andre løsninger, der kan identificere udbetalinger, som er forbundet med højst risiko.


I jobbet kommer du til at udvikle på en Python-baseret platform, hvor der er styr på versionsstyring, review-processer, test af kode, og hvor vi tager vores modeller seriøst ved at sikre højt niveau i vores MLops. 


Mere konkret bliver det dig, der:



sørger for, at vores framework til udvikling af analyser og løsninger virker smart og understøtter effektive udviklingsmetoder

videreudvikler vores nuværende Python-baserede platform til registersamkøring

udvikler applikationer, api’er, pipelines, kodekvalitetstjek og andre støtteværktøjer

kravsætter behov og omsætter det til robuste IT-løsninger.



Kan du arbejde med data på en struktureret og analytisk måde?
Der kan være flere veje til jobbet som Software Developer hos os, men vi forestiller os, at du har en relevant uddannelse som fx ingeniør, matematiker, datalog, cand.it eller lignende. Det vigtigste er dog, at du: 



har interesse for at håndtere og analysere store datasæt og er helt hjemme i Python

har kendskab til softwareudviklingsprincipper.



Erfaring med systemer og værktøjer som fx Git, Azure DevOps, Scrum, Flask, SQLalchemy, Kubernetes, JubiterHub og Flyte er en fordel.


Som person er du struktureret, og du sætter pris på en udfordrende og varieret hverdag, hvor du får brug for dine analytiske og kommunikative evner. Du kan arbejde selvstændigt, når vi har hjulpet dig godt ombord i opgaverne, du tager ansvar for opgaveløsningen, og så vil du arbejde et sted, hvor du har mulighed for at udvikle dig inden for data science og softwareudvikling (vi søger også en data analyst lige nu, som du kan læse om her: www.atp.dk/karriere/data-analyst-til-data-mining-fraud-detection-184106. )


Vil du arbejde til gavn for det danske samfund?
I Data Mining & Fraud Detection bliver du en del af et team bestående af 30 dygtige kolleger, der har ansvaret for at udvikle løsninger og værktøjer, der gør offentlige myndigheder i stand til at gennemføre koordinerede kontroller med en lang række velfærdsydelser. 


Vi opererer blandt andet med softwareudvikling, webservices og data science, og vi har som central specialenhed fokus på at forebygge og identificere fejludbetalinger, så de hurtigst muligt korrigeres og undgås i fremtiden.


I ATP tilbyder vi et arbejdsliv i balance. Det kræver fleksibilitet med plads til den enkelte. Og det har vi. Vi ser fleksibilitet som en gensidig interesse, hvor vi sammen har fokus på trivsel, opgaveløsning og kundernes behov.


Du vil blive en del af en arbejdsplads, hvor vi stiller høje krav til din faglighed, og du vil blive mødt af en forventning om at tage ansvar, stille spørgsmål og udvikle dig selv og de fællesskaber, du bliver en del af. Vi ved nemlig, at engagerede medarbejdere er altafgørende for, at vi når vores mål og bliver ved med at være de bedste til at løse vigtige samfundsopgaver.


dig? Så send os dit CV
Du behøver ikke at sende os en lang ansøgning. Vi er mere interesserede i dit CV og et par linjer om, hvorfor du er interesseret i jobbet.


Vi behandler henvendelser løbende og indkalder til samtaler fra uge 43. Vi fjerner opslaget, når vi har fundet den rette kandidat. 


Du kan læse mere om rekrutteringsforløbet her: https://www.atp.dk/rekrutteringsforloeb-i-atp 


Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte sektionschef Emil Nygaard Jørgensen på tlf. 2499 8491 eller mail enj@atp.dk.


 Til annoncører, search- og rekrutteringsbureauer: ATP frabeder sig venligst uopfordrede henvendelser vedrørende annoncering af stillingsopslag og kandidater fra headhuntere og rekrutteringsbureauer. Vi ønsker heller ikke at modtage uopfordrede henvendelser vedrørende salg af tjenesteydelser og produkter i forbindelse med jobopslag. Vi beder om, at dette ønske respekteres, og at rekrutterende leder og andre medarbejdere ikke kontaktes i denne henseende."

Data Analyst til Data Mining & Fraud Detection,"ATP · Hillerød, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 16 applicants","About the job
Kan du omsætte data til værdifulde indsigter? Og vil du være med til at teste og udvikle løsninger, der sikrer, at velfærdsydelser havner i de rigtige lommer? Så er du den dataanalytiker, vi søger til Data Mining & Fraud Detection.
 
Vil du være med til at fremtidssikre velfærdssamfundet?
Data Mining & Fraud Detection er en del Digital Solution i ATP. Her interesserer vi os lidt mere for data end de fleste. Og særligt for, hvad data kan, når datakvaliteten er i top. Som Data Analyst i Data Mining & Fraud Detection vil du derfor bidrage til at sikre en koordineret indsats ift. kontrol af fejludbetalinger og snyd med offentlige ydelser i landets største udbetalingshus.


Du får mulighed for at bringe din tekniske viden i spil, når du hjælper med at udvikle modeller og andre løsninger, der kan identificere udbetalinger, som er forbundet med højst risiko.


Vi er organiseret i et agilt udviklingssetup tæt på forretningen. Det er derfor centralt, at du er nysgerrig på hele rejsen for dine produkter fra identificering af forretningsbehov, udvikling af model til produktionssætning og leverance.


Som Data Analyst er det bl.a. dig, der:



sætter dig ind i data, som kan omsættes til værdifulde indsigter for kolleger i andre dele af ATP

udvikler og tester udsøgningskriterier baseret på forretningsregler for at sikre forretningen mod de mest risikable fejlscenarier

kravsætter behovene fra andre områder og omsætter dem til robuste IT-løsninger i Python og SQL

indgår i tæt samarbejde med afdelingens øvrige specialister med fokus på at udvikle og teste nye løsninger.



Kan du arbejde med data på en struktureret og analytisk måde?
Der kan være flere veje til jobbet som Data Analyst hos os, men vi forestiller os, at du har en relevant uddannelse som fx ingeniør, matematiker, datalog, cand.it eller lignende. Det vigtigste er dog, at du: 



har erfaring med at håndtere og analysere store datasæt 

føler dig hjemme i Python og SQL og har et generelt godt kendskab til IT.



Eventuel erfaring med systemer og værktøjer som fx Git, Azure DevOps, Scrum, pandas, Flask, SQLalchemy er en fordel, men det er ikke et krav. 


Du er struktureret, analytisk, og så er du god til at kommunikere. Du sætter pris på en udfordrende og varieret hverdag, hvor du kan arbejde selvstændigt, når vi har hjulpet dig godt ombord i opgaverne, du tager ansvar for opgaveløsningen, og så vil du arbejde et sted, hvor du har mulighed for at udvikle dig inden for data science og softwareudvikling (vi søger også en software developer lige nu, som du kan læse om her: www.atp.dk/karriere/software-developer-til-data-mining-fraud-detection-184105 .)


Vil du arbejde til gavn for det danske samfund?
I Data Mining & Fraud Detection bliver du en del af et team bestående af 30 dygtige kolleger, der har ansvaret for at udvikle løsninger og værktøjer, der gør offentlige myndigheder i stand til at gennemføre koordinerede kontroller med en lang række velfærdsydelser. 


Vi opererer blandt andet med softwareudvikling, webservices og data science, og vi har som central specialenhed fokus på at forebygge og identificere fejludbetalinger, så de hurtigst muligt korrigeres og undgås i fremtiden.


I ATP tilbyder vi et arbejdsliv i balance. Det kræver fleksibilitet med plads til den enkelte. Og det har vi. Vi ser fleksibilitet som en gensidig interesse, hvor vi sammen har fokus på trivsel, opgaveløsning og kundernes behov.


Du vil blive en del af en arbejdsplads, hvor vi stiller høje krav til din faglighed, og du vil blive mødt af en forventning om at tage ansvar, stille spørgsmål og udvikle dig selv og de fællesskaber, du bliver en del af. Vi ved nemlig, at engagerede medarbejdere er altafgørende for, at vi når vores mål og bliver ved med at være de bedste til at løse vigtige samfundsopgaver.


=dig? Så send os dit CV
Du behøver ikke at sende os en lang ansøgning. Vi er mere interesserede i dit CV og et par linjer om, hvorfor du er interesseret i jobbet.


Vi behandler henvendelser løbende og indkalder til samtaler fra uge 43. Vi fjerner opslaget, når vi har fundet den rette kandidat.

Dertil har jeg oplevet et meget struktureret og lærerigt praktikforløb, hvor jeg hele tiden havde en opgave at løse. Dette gjorde, at jeg følte mig som del af teamet - ikke bare som en ‘intern’.”

Du vil samarbejde tæt med specialisterne i teamet for at hjælpe vores kunder med at integrere vores løsninger samt videreudvikle dem.
Derudover vil du komme til at arbejde i dybden med de enterpriseværktøjer, der tilbydes på Google Marketing Platform.

Nede på jorden og ser stor værdi i samarbejde

The Company And Our Growth

Morningscore is a rapidly growing SAAS company. We have developed a gamified SEO tool, which now has about 1000 in +35 countries.

We are a group of ambitious and determined people who value each other's company very much. We are therefore also an office-first company, but not by force. This should be understood in the sense that we do a lot together to create a workplace where it's fun and cooler to come into work than to sit remotely. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't work all the days remotely that you need to in order to make your life work as well as possible :) So there is room for the hybrid model.

The company is born global, which also means that the internal language is English. We are a good mixed bunch of 5 different nationalities having fun together and working to make SEO fun for everyone from beginners to experienced SEO geeks.

You enjoy building relationships with customers and solving their problems. For you, positive customer feedback makes you smile and brightens your day.
You lead with patience and kindness, especially when handling tough cases.
Strong ability to prioritize and “get sh*t done”. You possess a strong sense of urgency in driving projects to completion. Can speak to past experiences of getting projects across the finish line repeatedly and on-time.
Strong written and verbal communication skills along with the ability to explain technical topics to non-technical audiences.
You’re naturally curious, love learning new things, and are proactive in sharing knowledge with others.
High tolerance for ambiguity. You should be excited that your priorities will change over time, in large part based on what you see as the highest-impact end user issues that need to be resolved.
Low ego. You know when something is over your head and aren’t afraid to ask for help.

Bonus Qualifications

Cybersecurity knowledge or experience
Experience with our customer support stack is helpful but not required (ZenDesk, Asana, Jira, Confluence, Slack)

Har du et tydeligt menneskeligt og pædagogisk ståsted, der kan tåle de nødvendige forstyrrelser, som udvikling kræver, og som rummer værdier som engagement, glæde, respekt, demokrati og fællesskab?

Er du sprængfyldt med gode ideer til fritidsaktiviteter, og kan du være til stede med både nærvær, nysgerrighed, alvor, anerkendelse, venlighed og humor? Er du både fleksibel og struktureret? Og kan du få ting til at ske?Brænder du for aktiviteter som f.eks. friluftsliv, røg og bål? Er du helt vild med sport, bevægelse, dans og rytmik? Holder du af dyr som høns, marsvin og heste? Drømmer du om at lave digitale aktiviteter og danne børnene i den digitale verden? Eller er det måske mere træværksted og ”mekanik”? Er du til drama, skuespil og rollespil/leg? Eller er det noget helt syvende du brænder for… Så er det måske dig vi leder efter.

Møllehøjskolen er en skole, hvor SFO, klub og undervisning har en stærk fælles identitet. Vi har en stor opbakning i skoledistriktet og gode fysiske rammer med luft og plads.

Vores fritidsdel består af SFO samt fritids- og ungdomsklub. Pædagogisk er vi optaget af fællesskaber og hvad de betyder for børns udvikling. Vi er optaget af, hvordan man både bliver til noget og til nogen, og vi forsøger altid at møde børnene der, hvor de er.

Vi værdsætter fællesskabet højt på både børne- og voksenplan, og vores daglige morgensamling er en stor del af Møllehøjskolens identitet. Her mødes vi i det store fællesskab. Vi er en skole med ca. 340 elever fra 0. til og med 6. årgang, hvorefter vores elever fortsætter på Overlund skole.

Hvis du er pædagoguddannet og alt det her giver mening for dig – gad vide, om du så ikke skulle søge job som pædagog på Møllehøjskolen. Vi har brug for dig fra 1. januar 2024.

Der er tale om en fast stilling på 37 timer, men også med mulighed for nedsat tid, hvis du skulle ønske det. Vi tilbyder gode arbejdsforhold og fantastiske kolleger. Der vil i forbindelse med en ansættelse blive indhentet straffe og børneattest. Løn og ansættelse efter gældende overenskomst.

Analytics Engineer,"Tryg · Ballerup, Capital Region, Denmark Reposted  1 day ago  · 8 applicants","About the job
Do you have strong technical skills and experience with building data warehouse(s) combined with a good understanding of solving business problems with data? Then we offer you the opportunity to become part of the Shared Data Product team at Tryg!

 About us | Experience a culture of trust, cooperation, and co-development 

This is the right moment to join us, as we focus strongly on digitalization and innovation of our services and business processes. You will be part of our Nordic data group, which is responsible for all things data.

We have just expanded Tryg significantly and we are on an organizational journey to become more data-driven. The journey so far has been focused on building a common data provisioning platform. The platform is a cloud-based real-time streaming platform, built on open-source technology (Kafka, Kubernetes, CI/CD).

The next step of the journey is to take this data unity to the next level by building a consumption layer supporting business analysts. In contrast to a traditional data warehouse we focus on delivering a subset of common data products ourselves and have developers in other business units extend them using git-based collaboration processes.

This means that you as an Analytical Engineer will need to work on specific data products, where you are a main deliverer. But equally important, you have to be able to create and support a co-creation environment where developers from the different areas of the business can contribute and put speed on the development of data products for their specific areas.

 About the role |  Working in the space between the data platform and the consumer 

You will be a part of the Shared Data Product team , a growing team of four people, including you. As an Analytical Engineer, you will be working in the space between the data platform and the consumer, and converting the raw data of the platform into a foundation that can be used by consumers.

As part of this, you need to be able to share and adapt your ways of working and together with the rest of the team convert it into clear git-based processes for working with the code.

You need to engage with both data engineers to understand the data implementation and the business analysts/business owners to understand the business context to drive the generation of data products. Your first assignment will be to work on a data product for commission payment while contributing to the process and build-up of the team itself.

Your key tasks are:

 Providing “clean” transformed data ready for analysis 
 Apply Software engineering best practices to analytics code (version control, testing, continuous integration) 
 Write complex SQL transformations, and maintain our data transformation codebase using dbt 
 Maintain data documentation and definitions 
 Think compliance first in the build of data products 
 Automation and streamlining of key data processing jobs (Data cleaning, historizing). 

 About you | Passion for working with a  modern data warehouse set-up including data modeling 

We imagine that you have a strong technical skillset from a modern data warehouse set-up including data modeling:

 Applied experience with the entire data modeling journey 
 Minimum SQL/DBT/Gitlab 
 Preferred: Cloud, Kubernetes, Python, JSON, GraphQL, YAML, and DataOps processes 
 Architectural understanding 
 Structured approach/process building 
 Strong problem-solving and analytical skills 
 Willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies 
 You communicate clearly in English and preferably in one Scandinavian language, both verbally and in writing. 

It is an advantage if you have experience in the insurance industry and in streaming architecture vs. batch architecture as well as an understanding of the ACORD model.

To be successful in the role you must be self-driven and strive to challenge the status quo in order to deliver high-quality data products. Also, we imagine that you will be a promoter of the organizational change needed to adapt to new ways of working.

 We look forward to hearing from you! 

If you have questions about the position, please contact Matilde Goul Dueholm at +45 42 92 62 81 or matilde.dueholm@tryg.dk .

Please send your application as soon as possible and  no later than 1 November 2023. 

We’ll be evaluating applications and conducting interviews continuously, and the position will be taken down when the right candidate is found.

Freelance Sr. Behavioral Research & Strategy Consultant to Help Farmers E Africa,Appleseed · Denmark  1 month ago  · 41 applicants,"About the job
⚠️This position may be based anywhere in the world (not necessarily Denmark or the US).

UPDATE: Thank you for your interest in this position and project! We have now staffed this project; however we anticipate future projects in Spring of 2024. If you wish to join our freelancer team and be considered for future projects, please continue to complete the application. Please be aware that our application review process may take some time as we carefully assess each candidate's qualifications, and we will reach out as soon as possible.

🔎 Appleseed is seeking a seasoned and well-rounded freelance behavioral practitioner (design / marketing / ethnographic researcher & strategist) to serve in a Deputy role on a project with a client in E Africa. This collaborator would be a client-facing consultant, ready to join the team to conduct research & strategy, both remotely and in the field. Must also share our core values and have the experience and disposition needed to thrive on a globally-distributed small team. Ideally (but not required), we are hoping to find someone interested in joining the Appleseed core team in the future, should the initial collaboration go well (more detail below). 
 Type of Role: Project-specific Independent Contractor
 Exploration of Fit: mid-August to mid-September
 Start Date: September 18, 2023
 Project Location / Estimated Duration: 4 months total
6 weeks remote part-time (12-16 hours/week)
3 weeks in November, in-person full-time, travel to E Africa
6 weeks remote part-time (12-16 hours/week)
 Fee range: USD $10,000 to $18,000 (negotiable; excludes reimbursable project-related expenses)

👆 Please feel free to apply even if you are unavailable or uninterested in this particular project, but are interested in exploring a fit. We'd be happy to do that now, so when the right project opportunity comes up, we can team up with no delay!

Company Overview

🌍 Appleseed is a behavioral agency for global development. We are obsessed with one big problem across the sector: important solutions failing to stick.

Our clients are fighting to end poverty or protect the planet. When they struggle to engage people or drive uptake of a service, product, or idea, they and/or their funders will put us on the case. Appleseed consultants dive deep—taking an ethnographic approach to investigate the challenge and uncover human insights. Then we help our clients design accordingly and bring about changes required for impact.

We envision a day when all impact organizations design purely based on people’s needs and realities. We partner only with nonprofits and funders who seek to preserve human dignity as they go about fostering change within communities. See how we have enabled:

smallholder farmers in Senegal to space crops for higher yields 👩🏾‍🌾
 schoolchildren in Kenya to stop drinking contaminated water 🚱, or
farmers in Guatemala to plant a new kind of maize, fortified to combat malnutrition 🌽

Working with Appleseed, collaborators may expect:

Flexible and fun organizational culture
Interesting and meaningful challenges and travel experience
Exposure to a network of top social impact leaders (doers and funders)
Small team of candid, curious, fun, and motivated colleagues

To learn more, visit www.appleseedimpact.org

Project Briefing

The client on this engagement is an award-winning social impact organization based in East Africa. The majority of the funding comes from a foundation who is part of the Big Bang Philanthropy consortium. The target audience will be smallholder farmers in either Burundi, Malawi, or Kenya (TBD), and the behavioral challenge is to get farmers to space their crops appropriately to maximize yield, income, and soil resilience.

The collaboration would start with part-time remote preparation: internal onboarding of new team members to Appleseed culture and methodology, data / literature review, stakeholder interviews, project kick-off with the Client, and research planning. Then, we will travel to conduct a ~3 week in-country stint for field research, likely in November. This 3-week in-country stint would be full-time and all-consuming. This research stint will be followed by part-time remote work: research reporting, facilitating acceptance of research insights, and co-designing a strategic playbook with the Client. We would aim to complete the Research Phase before mid-December, and then the Strategy Phase in January 2024. The Client will then be responsible for experimentation / implementation, based on the behavioral strategy we delivered.

Philip Kao, Director of Appleseed, will lead this project as the client manager, lead researcher and strategist. If you were to join the project, you'd serve in the role as Deputy Behavioral Researcher & Strategist (you and Philip would form the core team). This 2-person team would be supported by a Research Assistant helping remotely with data processing, analysis, and reporting, as well as by another Appleseed team member helping remotely as a thought-partner throughout the project. During the in-country research stint, two client-side team members would join our research team to conduct mixed-method qualitative research. Fixers and interpreters will be provided by the client or hired as needed.

The Role

🦸 As a Senior Behavioral / UX Consultant, you would deliver world-class service to our clients around the world -- on the client project described above, and/or others in the future. To do this, you would serve in a Deputy role, helping the team leader to carry out client engagements from end-to-end. This would entail preparing for and conducting investigative research in the field, analyzing data and reporting insights, producing strategic recommendations, and always upholding Appleseed's brand promise to clients.

As part of Appleseed's inner circle of collaborators, you'd have ongoing chances to work on diverse issues, from agriculture, financial inclusion, WASH, infectious diseases, vision, and more, all while getting a privileged behind-the-scenes look at the operations of various impact organizations. You would also have the chance to learn from and contribute to our model, org culture, aspects of service delivery, and the various techniques we use to uncover and communicate behavioral insights.

If you find all of this exciting, we now invite you to consider our requirements and expectations for this role.

Requirements

🔎 Qualifications

 The Craft and Expertise of Changing Behavior: pursuing mastery in the art and skill of fostering positive and sustainable behavior change. Significant practical experience and theoretical knowledge in a related field, such as marketing or design. This requirement is non-negotiable, and candidates will be tested
 B2B Consulting Ability: ideally demonstrated with years of proven track record, great client relationships, and experience showing the diverse skill set required to run the full project lifecycle. By “consultant” we mean you were hired by a client (typically another organization) to deliver services and solve problems on their behalf, and NOT as part of an academic endeavor
 Field-Readiness: ideally this would be demonstrated by having led field investigations researching people in places analogous to where we work (e.g. rural villages, informal settlements, etc. of Africa, Asia, and Latin America). Researchers must be ready to live for several days with and among those living in extreme poverty (possibly in places with no running water, electricity, or toilets, sleeping on concrete floors, while dealing with mosquitoes and the risk of stomach bugs, etc.)
 Remote Teamwork Ability: being self-starting, communicative, accountable, and able to foster trust and belonging within a small remote team

🗝️ Responsibilities 
 Client Success: delivering impact and client satisfaction, by supporting the Project Lead and executing engagements from start to finish, via the following tasks:
Unbiased, mostly qualitative, ethnographic research (field and remote)
Development of strategic recommendations
Leading clients to internalize findings and accept recommendations
Guidance on lean experimentation (if scoped)
Client management
Note: our engagements focus much more on research & strategy, vs. design/build & implementation
 Team and Project Management: maintaining a healthy culture and staying true to Appleseed's core values; managing and training yourself, junior team members, and possibly other freelancers—to achieve objectives on-method, on-time, on-budget

Expectations

12 weeks remote part-time, 3 weeks in-person full-time (international travel required)
Collaborating with the Client and team members in different time zones
Target start date: September 18, 2023
Estimated end date: end of January, 2024

We trust you to self-filter based on the requirements above and the statements below, so that we may either explore a fit or avoid wasting each other’s time! Culture fit is paramount to us, and we have a good sense of what will / won’t work out. If any of these criteria take you out of the running, but you would still like to get in touch, please write us: team@appleseedimpact.org. If these criteria encourage you to apply, we look forward to hearing from you!

Please Do NOT Apply If… 🛑

Your familiarity with the work of changing behavior (however you call it) is more theoretical than practical. I.e. it comes more from books, school, academia, or the experiences of others, instead of your own past efforts
You're looking for an entry-level or mid-level position (in the future, we’ll be adding and training less experienced Behavioral Consultants that fit a similar profile as described here. If this interests you, please use this form instead: https://team350377.typeform.com/to/guXQ0vq6)
You cannot name several different teams that you’d be happy for us to call and ask about how you’ve collaborated and added value
Adventure isn’t in your DNA
It would be very jarring for you to spend time on a research trip (and possibly spend the night) in a village or urban slum without running water, electricity, or a toilet, while dealing with mosquitoes and the risk of stomach bugs
You take significant pride in being a perfectionist or workaholic
You consider yourself to be very wise

Benefits

Compensation

Project fee in the range of USD $10,000 to $18,000 (negotiable), which includes all applicable taxes. This fee is exclusive of travel and other project-related expenses to be reimbursed by Appleseed

Hiring Process

The team expects to evaluate shortlisted candidates in August, before coming to terms with the best-fitting candidate by mid-September. Our process will be a two-way conversation to set up a win-win scenario. Applicants are free to suggest other steps, and we always welcome feedback on the candidate experience.

STAGE 1️⃣ If you believe there's a great fit worth exploring, please answer a questionnaire by clicking ""Apply for this job"" below. You can expect to hear back promptly. Select candidates will be asked to have a quick exploratory chat (20 min). If we both agree to continue, we'll ask you to share a few work samples and references
STAGE 2️⃣ Starting mid-August, qualified candidates will be given a fictional scenario and asked to set up, conduct, and record an interview with a volunteer + write up any insights or recommendations
STAGE 3️⃣ Semi-finalists who reach this stage will join a 60-minute call with Philip and/or Baptiste to exchange questions & feedback, and to get a feel for the team dynamic. 

We know this process will require time and energy investment from both sides, but we think it behooves us to do so to seriously explore a fit. Appleseed is building an inner circle of trusted collaborators, who will be needed on every project we do. If successful, you may expect this one-time exploration of fit to translate into years of fruitful collaboration!

👆 Please feel free to apply even if you are unavailable or uninterested in this particular project, but are interested in exploring a fit. We'd be happy to do that now, so when the right project opportunity comes up, we can team up with no delay!

If you have any questions or comments, please email us at team@appleseedimpact.org. We respect and thank you in advance for the time and energy you spend going through the application process!🙏

Interested in Joining Appleseed's Core Team?

🚀 Founded in 2015 in California, Appleseed has now served clients and communities in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, on a range of issues, such as child malnutrition, WASH, financial inclusion, sustainable agriculture, and more. With a proven methodology, strong reputation, and earned-revenue model that is sustaining, we are successfully bringing behavioral expertise to a challenging new market.

Now out of the startup phase, we believe the next piece of the puzzle is “team replication”—so we wish to add a couple more top-notch Senior Consultants (full-time employees) to the Core Team who can deliver on our brand promise, lead projects, and help run the business! Ideally, this would be someone who has demonstrated success by working with us on at least one project as a freelancer.

Differences from the Freelance Deputy Role

As a Core Team Member, you would be a full-time (4 days per week) employee, helping to shape various facets of the organization to bring about our envisioned future: every impact organization designing for their audiences to make critical solutions stick.

Compared to the JD for the freelance deputy position above, Core Team Members must meet the same qualifications, and would take on these additional responsibilities: Leading Client Engagements, Training, and Building the Business.

Compensation: Paid annual salary range starting at USD $80,000, with growth plan in place to reach and exceed USD $100,000, unlimited leave for vacation/sick/holiday, annual stipends for workspace upgrades, professional development, and healthcare if needed.

If you're interested, please apply for the project above or let us know you'd like to be considered for future opportunities!"

Full-stack developer for product team internship in fast growing top tier digital agency,"The Hub · Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 15 applicants","About the job
Looking for an internship in web development? Kickstart your career at Twentyfour!

We are always looking for passionate and motivated people who want to get started in the professional world of front-end development. Are you one of those? Then this is your place!

Who is Twentyfour?

Twentyfour is a 10-year-old online software development agency working in the cool 24Labs (24labs.dk) on Amager in Copenhagen together with companies such as Eatie, EasyPractice, Triptale and few others.

We are a team of around 30 people, including 10 different nationalities. However, we all have a couple of things in common. The first one is the desire to be involved with difficult projects and complex solutions. The second one is that we all like to have a cold beer on Fridays with our lovely colleagues.

We are working at a high speed and with a great portion of passion for what we do
We are really nice people (if we are to say so ourselves) and we are working in informal surroundings 
We have great lunch 
We have lots of social activities and fun across our teams (table football, table tennis, friday bars, team building events etc.)
An internship in Twentyfour can kick start your future career and expand your professional network

What We Do

We solve problems for our customers by developing, integrating and maintaining complex systems and websites.

We do this by providing our team with the tools, challenges and colleagues needed in order to solve interesting problems and enjoy their day-to-day with as little unnecessary stress as possible while we grow our business areas and transition to become primarily driven by recurring revenue.

This way we can work our best with the customers, projects and products that are the right match.

We work with large Danish institutions and corporations such as Danmarks Nationalbank, Ørsted, DR, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Green Mobility, Ferrosan, Amnesty International, Folketinget (The Danish Parliament) and many more.

For this position specifically, you'll be working with one of the products developed by Twentyfour - Boligforeningsweb.

Boligforeningsweb is a product developed by Twentyfour in collaboration with Andelsboligforeningernes Fællesrepræsentation (ABF).

The product is primarily aimed at Danish Andelsboligforeninger (shared ownership housing cooperatives) that would like to have a website to show their association externally and also have an intranet for the residents with all the important information. The idea is to provide a simple website template that is easy to work with and manage by people who don’t necessarily have extensive technical knowledge. At the same time it gives the opportunity to customize the pages via a frontend editor to give them a personal touch for people who are willing to put some extra effort into it.

You can read more about it on https://boligforeningsweb.dk

Who are you?

We imagine that your studies are about web development, computer science or similar.

You are a rationally thinking, hard working person and a good team player but also know how to work independently and you are not afraid of challenges or taking responsibility. We expect you to be creative and to not be afraid to speak up your mind.

Your nationality or background does not matter, but we expect you to be very interested in learning and it is required that you know at least HTML, CSS and JavaScript and/or some other relevant programming language.

Our program

We Have Two Internship Programs

10 weeks full time 
4-6 months full time

The 10 weeks internship is aimed at students from KEA or similar educational institutions. After the 10 weeks, we have good experience with interns writing their final project in collaboration with Twentyfour.

The 4-6 months internship is aimed at students who wants to dive into some of our bigger projects. And 10 weeks would not be enough for these projects. But do not worry. No matter which program you apply for, you will not be brewing coffee for anyone ;-)

We like to take good care of our interns and assign you with a mentor during your time here. After a completed internship, we always consider increasing our team. Therefore, we usually hire two to four interns each year after their programs if there is a good match.

For this position, the typical tasks that you can expect to work with are:

Maintenance of the solution
Fixing bugs reported by users
Implementing new features to the theme
Developing internal tools to make it easier to maintain the solution

Our solution consists of the website template (frontend & backend) and an architecture around it that makes generating and maintaining websites easier. You’ll get the chance to work with the different parts of the solution with the possibility of specializing in a particular area depending on your competencies and personal interests.

While you’ll be working specifically with the BFW product, you’ll be part of Twentyfour’s development team. This means that you’ll have the opportunity to get help and support from our entire development team working on a wide range of different projects.

The Tech Stack That You’ll Work With Is

HTML / CSS / JavaScript
Stylus / jQuery / Bootstrap
PHP
Python
Docker
Git / BitBucket

Besides Technical Skills, You’ll Also Learn About

Product and project management
Customer relationship management
Quality assurance

RPA-konsulent til Intelligent Process Automation,"ATP · Hillerød, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 13 applicants","About the job
Kan du skabe fantastiske robotter, der gør en forskel for forretningen? Har du styr på de nyeste RPA-muligheder? Og kan du omsætte det til skræddersyede automatiseringsløsninger til gavn for hele Danmark? Så er det dig, vi søger. 
Interesserer du dig for magien i teknologi og automatisering?
Siden 2015 har vi anvendt RPA i arbejdet med at levere omkostningseffektiv sagsbehandling og kundeservice af høj kvalitet. Vi har allerede automatiseret mere end 400.000 timers arbejde, men vi har ambitioner om endnu flere. 


Derfor er vi på udkig efter dig, der vil arbejde for at gøre tingene smartere til gavn for et effektivt velfærdssystem.


I jobbet som RPA-konsulent er det dig, der:



udvikler softwarerobotter i Blue Prism, der skaber værdi for vores forretning

varetager driften af robotterne og supporterer vores RPA-processer og herunder et samspil mellem vores systemer, RPA Supervisor (CTwo), Blue Prism, vores infrastrukturleverandør og samarbejdspartner 

leverer høj service i opgaveløsningen og kan sparre med kolleger i andre dele af forretningen.



Har du et bredt IT-kendskab?
Det er selvsagt en fordel, hvis du allerede har kendskab til bogen med RPA-formularer og drift og support af RPA. Vi benytter i dag Blue Prism som teknologi men kigger også mod Power-platformen og andre teknologier. Vi håber derfor, at du: 



har erfaring med udvikling af automatiseringsløsninger

har tekniske IT-kompetencer samt en god forretningsforståelse

forstår forskellige udviklingssprog og kan programmere

vil gå nye veje, da vi hele tiden kigger på, hvordan vi kan forbedre os og hvilke teknologier, vi kan drage nytte af.



Som person er du løsningsorienteret og har sans for detaljer. Lige så snart du kaster dine øjne på nye processer, tænker du over, hvordan de kan automatiseres. 


Du leverer altid kvalitetsbevidste løsninger, som virker nu og på lang sigt. Du afvejer fordele og ulemper ved forskellige løsninger og udfordrer forretningsgange, hvor det giver mening. Du er drevet af at løfte i flok, men kan også arbejde selvstændig og løbe opgaver i mål på egen hånd. 


Vil du arbejde med et af landets største datagrundlag?
Som landets største udbetalingshus administrerer ATP to ud af tre velfærdskroner, der udbetales i Danmark. Det betyder, at vi arbejder med et datagrundlag, du ikke finder andre steder.


Som vores nye RPA-konsulent bliver du en del af vores Intelligent Process Automation-team i afdelingen, Data under Digital Solutions. Du kan se mere om, hvad vi laver i Digital Solutions her: https://www.atp.dk/digital-solutions 


I Intelligent Process Automation er vi et mindre team bestående af seks gode kolleger med forskellige interesser. Fælles for os alle er, at vi vægter fagligheden højt, og at vi er nysgerrige på ny teknologi og nye løsninger. Vi har en uformel tilgang til vores opgaveløsning og hinanden, tænker utraditionelt og udfordrer gerne plejer for at udvikle fede løsninger.


Hos os er barren sat højt, både når det gælder faglighed, godt kollegaskab, trivsel og sundhed. Et sundt arbejdsliv kræver en fleksibel arbejdsplads med plads til den enkelte medarbejder – og det har vi. Vi ser fleksibilitet som en gensidig interesse, hvor vi sammen har fokus på trivsel, opgaveløsning og kundernes behov. 


=dig? Så send os dit CV
Du behøver ikke at sende os en lang ansøgning. Vi er mere interesserede i dit CV, en kort tekst vedr. din motivation for at søge stillingen og så måske en sidste ting, der giver os et indtryk af dig. Det kan være et link til en kort YouTube-video, en idé du ikke kan slippe eller noget tredje. 


Der er ansøgningsfrist mandag den 30. oktober. Vi behandler henvendelser løbende og håber på opstart hurtigst muligt.


Har du spørgsmål til stillingen, er du velkommen til at kontakte afdelingschef for Analysis & Customer Insights Anders Lungholt på telefon 2533 6040 eller anln@atp.dk.




 

 Til annoncører, search- og rekrutteringsbureauer: ATP frabeder sig venligst uopfordrede henvendelser vedrørende annoncering af stillingsopslag og kandidater fra headhuntere og rekrutteringsbureauer. Vi ønsker heller ikke at modtage uopfordrede henvendelser vedrørende salg af tjenesteydelser og produkter i forbindelse med jobopslag. Vi beder om, at dette ønske respekteres, og at rekrutterende leder og andre medarbejdere ikke kontaktes i denne henseende."

Quality Control Technician - Relocation to Malta,Magro Brothers · Denmark  2 weeks ago  · 22 applicants,"About the job
Magro Brothers Group of Companies is a private, family-owned organisation. It finds its roots in 1916 when three Magro brothers joined their father`s business as general provisions merchants.

In 1934 they ventured in the processing and canning of fresh tomatoes and subsequently branched into a number of other business activities including the importation into Malta of livestock, fodder and foodstuffs and exports of local agricultural produce.

In 1977, John and Michael Magro, the sons of one of the first partners, took over the running of the business and further expanded their activities to include tinplate can manufacture, food distribution, retailing, advertising & marketing, property development.

In 1995, the company moved to a purposely built factory with a covered area of 27,000 square metres which today has become a centre of excellence for food processing in the Mediterranean.

In December 2013, John and Michael, being the 3rd generation in the Magro Brothers business enterprise, transferred their shares to John’s children namely, Christian, Nicholas and Joanna. Christian was appointed C.E.O. of the Group in January 2018 while John remains chairman of the Group and Michael continues to form part of the main board of directors.

The backbone of the food sector of Magro Brothers Group of Companies is still the processing of fresh tomatoes – Magro Brothers (Foods) Ltd is the major company within the group. It is one of the few local companies which handle the whole production cycle of tomato related products, from the growing of crops to the distribution of the finished product. This also includes the production of tinplate-cans. The present production range is very diversified and includes canned tomatoes, table and pasta sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise and other condiments, thin sauces, jams and ready-to-eat jellies.

The company is also well established in several overseas markets with sales offices in UK and Ireland supplying high profile international brands. Presently the company exports some 45% of its production to 20 countries spread in four continents.

In 2004, as part of the company’s policy of diversification and living up to market expectations, Magro Brothers Group expanded their business to offer exclusive gifting and hampers of Maltese delicacies and crafts under the Savina Brand and, in 2010 they ventured also in the production of traditional Maltese cheeses and dairy products under the popular Hanini Brand.

Today, with over 100 years’ experience, Magro Brothers Group of Companies has become one of the leading enterprises in Malta and has gained the respect of the local business community and the trust of most financial and commercial organisations. The owners take pride into rigorously monitoring the crops and herds of the many Maltese and Gozitan farmers who regularly supply fresh agricultural produce and milk to their organisation. This has helped the company to achieve the well-deserved premier position in food processing in Malta.

The company is very proud of its Quality credentials and boasts a BRC Grade AA food safety certification, an Organic certification and ISO 22000. They offer brand owners a wealth of manufacturing expertise and specialize in private label.

Betjene kunderne ved kassen 
Sørge for, at butikken altid er flot og skinnende ren

Frontend udvikler til Zetlands digitale afdeling,"Zetland · København, Capital Region, Denmark  2 days ago  · 10 applicants","About the job
Zetland søger programmøren, som vil være med til at gøre det til verdens bedste oplevelse at lytte i vores app eller læse på vores hjemmeside (eller vice versa)

Om Zetland

Zetlands digitale platform er i rivende udvikling. Siden vores lancering som dagligt medie i 2016 har vi betragtet teknologi og design som ligeværdige dele af vores forretning og medlemsoplevelse. Vi er gået fra et dagligt, webbaseret, featuremedie på skrift til et levende dagligt medie på både lyd og skrift, som man kan finde i sin browser eller have med i lommen, hvor end man bevæger sig hen.

Dén udvikling er båret af nysgerrighed på vores medlemmer og et løfte om at udvikle teknologi, der bedst muligt understøtter vores journalistik i at sprede vigtig viden, nysgerrige samtaler og rum for fordybelse i en verden, der trænger vildt til dét.

Som en del af Zetlands digitale team (internt: EDB-holdet) lander du i et sprudlende hold af fem udviklere, dig selv inklusive, og en product manager.

Du får stor indflydelse på vores prisvindende produkt, og har mulighed for at være med i hele udviklingsfasen. Fra idé over implementering til produktion. Eksempelvis fik en af vores udviklere i efteråret en idé til at bruge OpenAI’s Whisper-model til at transskribere interviewbånd, og i dag hjælper Good Tape flere tusind journalister (og andre) verden over med at transskribere deres lydfiler. Automatisk.

Vi har et erklæret mål om at undgå silodannelse, så du vil også få art directors, journalister, officemanagere, eventkoordinatorer og kommunikationsfolk som kolleger. Hver dag klokken 12 spiser vi frokost sammen, hele virksomheden.

Zetland holder til på Njalsgade på Islands Brygge. Holdet er på kontoret de fleste dage om ugen, og du skal regne med som minimum at skulle være på kontoret tre dage om ugen. Foretrækker du hjemmearbejde ud over det, så er det selvfølgelig muligt.

Om det, vi laver

Vi synes, at Zetland er bedst, når journalistik, design og teknologi mødes. Når vi leverer et produkt, som hjælper vores medlemmer i deres dagligdag – og når oplevelsen ovenikøbet er skruet sammen på en måde, så man kan mærke, at menneskene bag har lagt kræfter og kærlighed i. Du kan læse mere om vores principper lige her.

Vi har ansvaret for at bygge mange forskellige ting på Zetland: vores udgivelsesplatform, hjemmeside og apps bygger vi selv i huset.

Vi har desuden konstant øjne på, hvordan vi bedst muligt – i samarbejde med redaktionen og resten af huset – kan gøre det fedest muligt at arbejde på Zetland. (Derfor: Good Tape.)

Om rollen

Zetlands EDB-hold er et ambitiøst hold af udviklere med bred erfaring inden for app, web og backend teknologier. Vi arbejder tæt sammen, er glade for pair programming og delt ansvar. Vi er nysgerrige på hinandens holdninger til, hvad god teknologi er og skal kunne.

Vi arbejder i seks ugers cycles med to ugers cooldown, (forholdsvist udogmatisk) baseret på Basecamps Shape Up-filosofi. Projektholdene får masser af ansvar for at forme og hakke projekterne til sideløbende med, at de bygger, og vi sammen bliver klogere.

Vi støtter hinanden, og her er plads til at lære. De eneste dumme spørgsmål er dem, der ikke bliver stillet. Du kan læse meget mere om vores arbejdskultur lige her.

Til Daglig Arbejder Vi i Disse Teknologier
Vores backend er en Ruby on Rails-applikation, som har hovedansvaret for at snakke med vores forskellige services og sende data ud til web og apps. Den er baseret på filosofierne domain-driven design og event-driven development.
Vores frontend er i Next.js, som er et React-baseret framework.
Vi udgiver apps til både iOS og Android, som er bygget i React Native.
Om dig

Du er en udvikler, der kan se hele billedet, og kan sætte dig ind i, hvordan vores medlemmer har det, når de bruger vores software.

Når du skriver kode, gør du dig umage. Fordi du godt ved, at dem, der senere skal læse din kode, har brug for mest muligt hjælp til at forstå, hvad der foregår. Fordi du ved, at vi selv skal bo i det hus, vi bygger sammen.

Vi Forestiller Os At Du Er En Udvikler Med Minimum 3 Års Erfaring Med Backend- Og Webteknologier. Det Er Selvfølgelig Et Plus, Hvis
du er en tryllekunstner i React Native,
har en ting for Tailwind CSS,
eller elsker at nørde med animationer i Framer Motion.
Men det vigtigste er, at du har en solid forståelse for programmering, en nysgerrighed på at lære og kan spejle dig selv i Zetland og vores værdier.

Mest af alt synes du, at journalistik er vigtigt. Hvis du interesserer dig for samfundet, leverer vi til gengæld den sjoveste og mest meningsfulde arbejdsplads, du kan forestille dig. Fuld fart frem mod at give nysgerrige mennesker det overblik, de drømmer om, i en verden fuld af støj.

Dine Kvaliteter På Dag Ét
Du har et stærkt fagligt fundament.
Du modtager og giver feedback på en konstruktiv måde.
Du er nysgerrig på nye teknologier og måder at gøre tingene på.
Du tager ansvar for dit arbejde og følger det til dørs.
Vi forsøger i videst muligt omfang at ansætte forskellige mennesker, hvad angår for eksempel køn, hudfarve, klassebaggrund, politiske holdninger, religion, fødested og temperament. Så vi opfordrer enhver interesseret til at søge løs. Også selvom du ikke kan sætte hak i alle boksene endnu.

Opstart og løn

Vi interviewer kandidater løbende, så send din ansøgning snarest muligt. Vi er fair med vores løn, har ordentlige vilkår og ved, hvad en god produktorienteret udvikler er værd.

Hvis du har spørgsmål, så tøv ikke med at ringe eller skrive til produktchef, Sebastian Winther, på +45 3113 6654 eller sebastian@zetland.dk."

Storkøbenhavn

Har du mod på og kompetencer til at supportere testmiljøer i en kompleks infrastruktur? Er du klar til at gøre en forskel for samfundet og være med til at sikre at vi kan kvalitetssikre vigtige it-systemer til politiet? Vil du være en del af et super fedt team med masser af humor, nysgerrighed, viden og faglighed? Så skal du måske være en del af vores Testsupport team.

I Rigspolitiets testsektion har vi rigtig mange spændende, udfordrende, vilde, store og meget store, og ikke mindst samfundskritiske it-projekter. For at kunne teste disse skal testmiljøerne være klar, når projekterne skal bruge dem, der skal være adgange og klienter at teste på, servere skal være vedligeholdt og produktionslignende. De projekter, der skal bruge vores testmiljøer er komplekse, og det gælder også for vores infrastruktur. Vi har derfor brug for et kvikt hoved, der trives i feltet mellem support og infrastruktur. Som IT-Konsulent i Rigspolitiet har du ansvaret for at testmiljøerne er klar til tiden. Dette sker i samarbejde med vores løsningsarkitekter, testere, testmanagere og projektledere. Du har ligeledes ansvar for at fejlsøge og rette, når der opleves knuder i miljøet, således der opleves mindst mulig spildtid under testen.

Er du frisk?

Kvalifikation og viden vi efterlyser i Testsupport

 Du har viden om Windows infrastruktur (AD, DNS, DHCP)
 Du har erfaring med at implementere, drifte og vedligeholde Windows servere og klienter, og den tilhørende software
 Du har et godt kendskab til Windows servere og klienter i VMware
 Du har forståelse for IT-netværk, herunder IP adresser og VLAN

Hvem er du?

Vi forestiller os, at du er uddannet inden for IT. Du har erfaring med IT-support, infrastruktur og servere, og du har forståelse for vigtigheden af test.

Som kollega forestiller vi os at

 du elsker at befinde dig i feltet mellem servere, netværk, AD-grupper og udviklingsprojekter
 du har et godt overblik. Du arbejder struktureret og vedholdent - og forstår at sætte dig ind i komplicerede sammenhænge
 du er god til at tænke ud af boksen, får gode ideer og tør afprøve dem i samarbejde med dine kolleger
 du har gode samarbejdsevner og agerer serviceminded og professionelt i dine relationer – også når det skal gå stærkt
 du kommunikerer på dansk på et højt fagligt niveau i både skrift og tale, ligesom du behersker engelsk på et teknisk niveau i både skrift og tale

Hvem er vi?

Du bliver en del af Testsektionen i Center for Projekter, hvor vi pt. er en broget flok på 32 engagerede testmanagere, testere, testsupportere og studentermedhjælper med alle de forskelligheder du kan forestille dig. Tilfælles har vi et motto om at ”Test er en fest!”.

Vi er et team med faglig gennemslagskraft og vi samarbejder dynamisk og fleksibelt, idet alle testsupportere, testere og testmanagere sparrer med og supplerer hinanden. Vi værdsætter faglig udvikling, hvor vidensdeling på tværs af faggrupper og roller er en naturlig del af hverdagen. Har du ambitioner om på sigt at udfordre dine evner inden for nyere teknologi som fx Kubernetes og Docker, kunne det være en del af din udviklingsvej.

En typisk hverdag findes ikke! Du vil blive tilknyttet vores Testsupportteam, hvor supporten er det bærende element i din arbejdsdag. Dette betyder daglig kontakt med brugere af testmiljøerne i Koncern IT og resten af politiet. I Testkontoret finder du dine kolleger i Testsektionen som altid gerne vil sparre og rådgive om specifikke emner. Vi prioriterer at mødes alle sammen ind i mellem, vi mødes gerne og går en tur, afholder seminarer og sektionsmøder, hvor vi også samarbejder om vores faglighed.

Har du en akademisk baggrund, bliver du ansat på overenskomstvilkår i henhold til de til enhver tid gældende aftaler mellem Finansministeriet og Akademikernes Centralorganisation.

System/DevOps developer internship in fast growing top tier digital agency,"The Hub · Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 17 applicants","About the job
Looking for an internship in system/DevOps development? Kickstart your career at Twentyfour!

We are always looking for passionate and motivated people who want to get started in the professional front-end and back-end development. Are you one of those? Then this is your place!

Who is Twentyfour?

Twentyfour is a 10-year-old online software development agency working in the cool 24Labs (24labs.dk) on Amager in Copenhagen together with companies such as Eatie, EasyPractice, Triptale and few others.

We are a team of around 30 people, including 10 different nationalities. However, we all have a couple of things in common. The first one is the desire to be involved with difficult projects and complex solutions. The second one is that we all like to have a cold beer on Fridays with our lovely colleagues.

We are working at a high speed and with a great portion of passion for what we do
We are really nice people (if we are to say so ourselves) and we are working in informal surroundings 
We have great lunch 
We have lots of social activities and fun across our teams (table football, table tennis, friday bars, team building events etc.)
An internship in Twentyfour can kick start your future career and expand your professional network

What We Do

We solve problems for our customers by developing, integrating and maintaining complex systems and websites.

We do this by providing our team with the tools, challenges and colleagues needed in order to solve interesting problems and enjoy their day-to-day with as little unnecessary stress as possible while we grow our business areas and transition to become primarily driven by recurring revenue.

This way we can work our best with the customers, projects and products that are the right match.

We work with large danish institutions and corporations such as Danmarks Nationalbank, Ørsted, DR, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Green Mobility, Ferrosan, Amnesty International, Folketinget (The Danish Parliament) and many more.

Who are you?

We imagine that your studies are about web development, computer science or similar.

You are a rationally thinking, hard working person and a good team player but also know how to work independently and you are not afraid of challenges or taking responsibility. We expect you to be creative and to not be afraid to speak up your mind.

Your nationality or background does not matter, but we expect you to be very interested in learning and have some experience with Linux, since you will be in the terminal SSH'ing a lot. We expect you to have a general understanding of how servers and websites work, specifically NGINX, Apache, MariaDB and PHP.

Our program

We Have Two Internship Programs

10 weeks full time 
4-6 months full time

Søg jobbet

 Vil du være med til at understøtte og udvikle vores tilbud til københavnere i psykisk mistrivsel? Motiveres du af arbejdsopgaver, som har politisk og samfundsmæssig bevågenhed? Og har du en stærk profil indenfor analyse af kvantitative data? Så kan du være præcis den akademiske medarbejder, vi søger til Center for Mental Sundhed. 

Den psykiske mistrivsel er stigende, og flere og flere københavnere får stress, angst eller depression. I Center for Mental Sundhed skal vi bidrage til at vende den udvikling. Centret driver og udvikler forebyggende tilbud til borgere i København, som oplever symptomer på stress, angst, depression eller anden psykisk mistrivsel. Derudover samarbejder vi med andre aktører på sundhedsområdet om at fremme den mentale sundhed på måder, der rækker ud over vores kliniske møde mellem borger og psykolog.

Derfor har vi brug for dig

Vi søger en analyse- og metodestærk akademisk medarbejder til centrets tværfaglige stab, som med dig kommer til at bestå af i alt seks akademiske medarbejdere og to studentermedhjælpere.

Vi forestiller os, at du har en sundheds- eller samfundsvidenskabelig kandidatuddannelse med flere års erfaring, gerne fra en politisk styret organisation – f.eks. en styrelse, en region eller en kommune. Det er en fordel, hvis du har fagligt kendskab til de agendaer og udfordringer, der fylder ift. mental sundhed i et borger- og samfundsperspektiv.

Vi bestræber os på at være en datadrevet organisation, og en af dine hovedopgaver vil være at bidrage til at validere og analysere kvantitative data, der indsamles om de borgere, der får forløb i centret. Analyserne anvendes til udvikling og kvalificering af centrets eksisterende tilbud samt til at finde nye veje til at fremme københavnernes mentale trivsel i et bredere folkesundhedsperspektiv. Du vil også få ansvar for analyser, der kan bidrage til at forbedre de administrative arbejdsgange i driften med henblik på at mindske ventetiden for borgerne.

Som en del af centrets stab er der desuden en række forskellige stabsopgaver, du vil blive involveret i. Du vil få til opgave at understøtte ledelsen gennem udarbejdelse af ledelsesinformation, mødedagsordener, oplæg og mødefacilitering. Du vil kunne blive involveret i betjening af centralforvaltningen gennem hjælp til udarbejdelse af indstillinger, høringssvar, politikersvar mv. relateret til det mentale sundhedsområde. Du vil i dit daglige arbejde få brug for at trække på erfaringer med procesfacilitering og projektledelse.

Det er vigtigt, at du har et stærkt analytisk blik og trives med at bidrage til at finde gode løsninger på problemstillinger, som du selv er med til at afgrænse. Du skal se centrets tilbud, viden og muligheder i et bredt sundhedsmæssigt perspektiv, og du skal kunne formidle din viden til andre faggrupper både i tale og på skrift.

Som person er du samarbejdsorienteret, nysgerrig og kan motivere andre med engagement og faglig tyngde.

Om centret og staben

Staben understøtter vores ledelse og administrationen af centeret, og du vil komme til at indgå i et tæt samarbejde med vores nuværende fem akademiske medarbejdere og vores administration, der består af ni sekretærer. Fagligt og socialt kommer du til at indgå i fællesskaber med centrets mere end 60 psykologer. Vi er en stab i en organisation i vækst. Vi er fagligt ambitiøse og igangsætter løbende nye initiativer.

Center for Mental Sundhed er en arbejdsplads, der er kendetegnet ved involvering, samarbejde, gennemsigtighed og stor faglighed. Vi gør en dyd ud af at arbejde tæt sammen på tværs af vores kompetencer og at bruge hinanden aktivt, når vi skal løse vores opgaver.

I centret har vi en uformel omgangstone og mødes gerne over ugentlig fællesmeditation og månedlig fælles morgenmad.

Vi er en relativt lille stab, som arbejder tæt sammen med ledelsen, hvorfor du vil få stor indflydelse på centrets udvikling og drift. Hvis du er proaktiv og løsningsorienteret, kan du samtidig få stor indflydelse på dine arbejdsopgaver.

Pænt goddag 👋

Data skal være let tilgængeligt og ikke kræve en doktorgrad at forstå. Og det er netop det vi prøver at gøre for ejendomsbranchen. Vores daglige brød er at indsamle samt visualisere enhver type data der er relateret til ejendomme, så vi kan bane vejen for meget bedre beslutninger i branchen. Det samler vi på én platform og sælger på abonnement, så vores kunder aldrig mere skal tage beslutninger på mavefornemmelser eller forældede regneark. Med +1.000 betalende kunder og en abonnementsomsætning der har passeret +30mio DKK på tre års hårdt arbejde, så tør vi godt sige, at vi ikke var de eneste, som synes det var en udmærket ide. Stadig lidt for abstrakt? Se Lars Horsbøl (CEO) give en kort demo af vores software (link).

Så, i en nøddeskal, er det Resights. Eller faktisk ikke. For det som i virkeligheden definerer os, er de 40 mennesker der står bag vores software. En samling af nørdede holdspillere, der på rekordtid har bygget et af landets hurtigst voksende startups (på omsætning). Alt imens vi har haft det hamrende sjovt, for det er ganske enkelt en del af vores DNA.

Om dig

Vi forestiller os, at du har erfaring med ejendomme og investeringsmarkedet som helhed. Du skal have en stor interesse for det professionelle ejendomsmarked samt en forståelse for de grundlæggende nøgletal og analyser, der knytter sig til investeringsejendomme. Måske er du uddannet ejendomsmægler, erhvervsrådgiver hos en bank, jurist med speciale i fast ejendom, eller har en anden baggrund inden for fast ejendom? Og har lyst til at hoppe ombord på en ny satsning, som vil give dig den ultimative frihed til at udfolde din viden og talenter, i en scale-up virksomhed.

Hvis fagligheden er på plads, så er det vigtigst af alt en vurdering af dine talenter, og hvordan de passer til arbejdet og kulturen, som bestemmer om du bliver ansat. Her bruger vi et digitalt værktøj. Det tror vi er den mest fair måde at gøre det på, så det ikke omhandler alt muligt andet end dine evner til at løse opgaverne og få en arbejdsdag du ikke vil hjem fra. Ret simpelt.

Din mission er at etablere Resigths som fagligt fyrtårn i ejendomsbranchen 

Hos Resights har vi over de sidste tre år, på baggrund af vores omfattende arbejde med offentlige ejendomsdata, opbygget en enorm troværdighed i branchen. For at blive ved med at fortjene tilliden hos vores kunder, ønsker vi at investere mere i kvaliteten og formidlingen af de data, som førhen har været svært tilgængelige. Herunder særligt transaktions- og lejedata. Derfor opretter vi et nyt analytisk team med base i København, hvor du bliver første ansatte.

Langt størstedelen af landets større erhvervsmæglere, udviklere og ejendomsinvestorer er kunder. Dit arbejde kommer derfor i hænderne på den absolutte elite indenfor det professionelle ejendomsmarked i Danmark og Nordeuropa, hvilket giver gode muligheder for personlig branding og eksponering. Vores kunder tæller blandt andet Heimstaden, NREP, Niam, Blackstone, Rubik Properties - men også en lang række private investorer, som vi hjælper med at få adgang til omfattende data på ejendomme, der førhen kun har været forbeholdt de mest etablerede aktører.

Lidt nærmere om de konkrete ansvarsområder kan findes herunder.

 Opdatering og kvalitetssikring af databaser på leje- og transaktionsdata

Hos Resights har vi Danmarks største database på transaktioner, som indeholder samtlige digitalt tinglyste handler, men også ejendomme handlet som selskabshandler (48% af volumen i 2022). Vi har bygget en algoritme som opfanger de skjulte selskabshandler, men der skal stadig en analytikers øjne på, da vi ikke får angivet transaktionspris eller informationer om fx afkast, lejere og lignende. Du kommer altså til at kigge grundigt på samtlige ejendomshandler i Danmark over DKK 30 millioner og berige dem med data.

Vi har også opbygget Danmarks største database på konkret lejestatistik (enhedsniveau > byniveau). Vi har mere end 120.000 observationer, som vores kunder har indberettet anonymt til os.. Du har en analytiker på dit team, som behandler og strømliner dataen fra vores kunder, men du har det overordnede ansvar for at blive ved med at udvikle databasens størrelse, kvalitet og præsentation.

Med din ekspertise på dataene, vil du også være med til at medudvikle selve platformen. Præsenterer vi lejedataen bedst som vægtet gennemsnit eller median? Skal vi illustrere en tidsserie på lejeniveauer? Og tilsvarende spørgsmål er kritiske for at vi kan udvikle et produkt, hvor vores kunder høster det største udbytte.

 Udarbejdelse af kommercielle og strategiske analyser på ejendomsmarkedet

Hvordan udvikler lejeniveauet sig? Og hvad med tomgangsprocenter på tværs af anvendelser og områder? Forventer vi ændringer i markedsvilkår og hvordan påvirker det afkastkravet? Det er alle spørgsmål som ejendomsmarkedet følger tæt. Arbejdet med alle de store transaktioner (og aktører) herhjemme vil give dig en indsigt om markedets tilstand, som vi ønsker at formidle til vores kunder. Det er ikke noget vi har gjort i særligt stort omfang før og derfor skal konceptet bankes op fra bunden.

 Indgå i tæt dialog med vores kunder ifm. deling af viden om transaktioner

En stor del af værdien i de to forestående punkter skabes ved at etablere en relation til vores kunder, som dækker hele markedet og landet. Informationer på hovedparten af de større transaktioner er ikke offentligt tilgængelig og skal derfor indhentes gennem anonym deling af IMs, salgsprospekter og lignende. Du skal med andre ord være helt tæt på investorerne."

Two new colleagues for seismic data acquisition to the green transition,"GEUS · Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 12 applicants","About the job
Two positions are now available at the Department of Geophysics and Sedimentary Basins in the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). The positions will be within maintenance and use of seismic equipment, including newly acquired vibro-trucks, wireless units, and a land streamer. The positions are to be filled as soon as possible.

Job Description

The green transition in Denmark requires new data, and seismic data play a major role in this. Seismic surveys are carried out both onshore and offshore to investigate potential sites for CO2 storage, geothermal energy, wind farms, or energy islands. GEUS has a range of seismic gear ranging from onshore vibroseis equipment to marine reflection and refraction equipment.

In this position, your main role will be to maintain and operate newly acquired vibro-trucks or the onshore seismic recording system consisting of wireless units and a land streamer, both equipped with micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors . In GEUS we work multidisciplinary and across departments, so there are great possibilities to interact and participate in GEUS’ marine surveys in Danish and international waters, where maintenance and operation of compressors, streamers, airguns, and shallow seismic gear such as sparker systems and multibeam is needed.

The main workplace will be in Tåstrup, greater Copenhagen area, but there will also be trips to Aarhus in Jutland, where most of the marine gear is located. The candidate will be expected to carry out field work for extended periods.

Your Qualifications

The candidate could have a degree in geophysics, geology, engineering, or a technical education with knowledge of hydraulics, electronics, and/or mechanics.

Knowledge of the interface between the IT equipment and the seismic gear, experience with sensor apparatus such as digital accelerometers, and/or a general understanding of control technology will be essential. It will be an advantage if the candidate has experience with high-pressure hydraulic systems (5000 PSI) and understanding of hydraulic and electronic schematics. Experience with onshore vibroseis acquisition will also be an advantage, as will marine seismic acquisition be.

We work collaboratively, which requires efficient teamwork and good communication skills. Applicants must be fluent in English (spoken and written), and knowledge of Danish will be an advantage. If you do not speak Danish, you must be prepared to learn Danish to an appropriate level within the first 12 months of employment.

Department of Geophysics and Sedimentary Basins

The department’s main responsibilities are geological and geophysical tasks concerning energy resources, nature, and the environment. Its activities include participation in national and international research projects, mapping, and research in collaboration with the Danish and Greenlandic authorities in relation to externally funded research and consulting tasks, mainly concerning CCS, geothermal energy and energy storage.

The 27 specialised and dedicated people in the department participate in interdisciplinary consulting and research projects with universities and other research institutions. They do research and consulting within a broad range of geophysical and geological topics related to the deep subsurface, using advanced modelling and mapping tools, for example basin modelling and mapping of geological structures.

We offer
A lively and informal working environment with talented and dedicated colleagues
Versatile work duties and good opportunities to influence them
Development opportunities with access to courses and other further education
Family friendly workplace with flexible hours
An active social environment, with a staff association and art society
Fitness centre with physiotherapy at the workplace
 Salary and conditions of employment

In accordance with the collective agreements between the Danish Ministry of Finance and the relevant eligible trade union.

The appointment area is the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities and its institutions.

The Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities considers diversity to be an asset and invites anybody interested, regardless of gender, age, religion or ethnicity to apply for the position.

Akademiker til Rigspolitiets Arbejdsmiljøenhed – Vil du hjælpe med at reducere antallet af arbejdsulykker i dansk politi og skabe et bedre arbejdsmiljø for politiet?,"Politi · København, Capital Region, Denmark  3 days ago  · 1 applicant","About the job
København

Brænder du for at arbejde med fysisk arbejdsmiljø, og vil du gøre en forskel for betjentene i deres arbejde og medvirke til at forebygge ulykker og farlige situationer? Vil du være med til at drive et projekt, hvor sikkerhedskulturen i politiet forbedres og antallet af arbejdsulykker reduceres? I Center for Flåde- og Materielstyring har vi nu en ledig stilling i enheden for fysisk arbejdsmiljø. Du vil blive en vigtig brik i udviklingen af enheden og drive arbejdet med en konkret, politisk prioriteret opgave. Der er tale om en midlertidig stilling, der løber frem til udgangen af 2024.

Akademiker til Rigspolitiets Arbejdsmiljøenhed

I Center for Flåde- og Materielstyring indkøber, vedligeholder og udfaser vi køretøjer og materiel for hele politiet. Alt fra patroner til patruljebiler. Vi er en dynamisk, politisk styret organisation. Det betyder blandt andet, at man skal kunne trives med, at dagen ikke altid udvikler sig, som man havde forestillet sig, og at man kan blive mødt med krav fra både politi og politikere.

Arbejdsmiljøenheden arbejder strategisk med det fysiske arbejdsmiljø i politiet og tilbyder rådgivning i arbejdsmiljøspørgsmål til samtlige politikredse og afdelinger i Rigspolitiet. Enhedens medarbejdere er samtidig involveret i udviklingsprocessen, når der udvikles og anskaffes nyt politimateriel, og når der f.eks. skal træffes beslutning om indretningen af politiets køretøjer.

Arbejdsmiljøenheden har derfor en tæt tilknytning til det materiel, som vi anskaffer til politiet, hvorfor enheden er placeret i Center for Flåde- og Materielstyring.

Arbejdsmiljøenheden har fået til opgave at drive et projekt, der skal øge sikkerhedskulturen i politiet og dermed bidrage til en reduktion af antallet af arbejdsulykker. Projektet er en udløber af en politisk aftale mellem regeringen og arbejdsmarkeds parter, som løber over de kommende år. Som medarbejder i Arbejdsmiljøenheden bliver du tilknyttet dette projekt, og du vil i høj grad få mulighed for at påvirke både udviklingen og implementeringen af projektet. Arbejdsmiljøenheden består af 3 medarbejdere ud over dig, og er en del af sektionen Tværgående opgaver og Arbejdsmiljø, som samlet har 7 medarbejdere. Vi har en uformel omgangstone og et arbejdsmiljø præget af aktivitet, faglig sparring og ikke mindst godt humør.

Lidt om dig

Du har muligvis en akademisk uddannelse på bachelor eller kandidat niveau, men uddannelsens længde og retning er ikke det afgørende. Vi forventer dog, at du har konkret erhvervserfaring med projektarbejde inden for det fysiske arbejdsmiljøområde fra en privat eller offentlig organisation.

Du er ikke bange for at bringe din viden om arbejdsmiljø i spil, og det falder dig naturligt at tage ansvar for at planlægge, prioritere og følge op på dine arbejdsopgaver. Du skal kunne lide både det selvstændige arbejde, og dét at være en del af et team, hvor man hjælper og supplerer hinanden i dagligdagen. Du skal på samme tid kunne tage styring og skabe fremdrift i dine projekter.

Du trives i en udadvendt funktion, hvor du kan opbygge relationer og formidle et budskab. Som medarbejder i Arbejdsmiljøenheden har du en bred kontaktflade med både interne og eksterne interessenter, og det forventes, at du kan agere på mange forskellige niveauer i organisationen. I den sammenhæng er det vigtigt, at du evner at ”læse dit publikum”, så du kan levere den rette kommunikation til rette niveau og faggruppe.

Du kommer til at indgå i en lille enhed, hvor samarbejdet er en kerneværdi. Det er derfor vigtigt, at du kan dele ejerskabet til projekter og opgaver, da det er afgørende for, at opgaverne bliver løst.

Løn- og ansættelsesvilkår

Du bliver ansat på overenskomstvilkår i henhold til de til enhver tid gældende aftaler mellem Finansministeriet og Akademikernes Centralorganisation. Du bliver indplaceret på baggrund af dine kvalifikationer.

Ansættelsesområdet er Rigspolitiet, og dit arbejdssted bliver Rigspolitiet, Center for Flåde- og Materielstyring, Hambrosgade 21, 1780 København V.

Det er en forudsætning for ansættelse, at du kan blive sikkerhedsgodkendt, ligesom du skal kunne opretholde sikkerhedsgodkendelsen gennem hele din ansættelse.

Kontakt og ansøgning

Har du spørgsmål, er du velkommen til at kontakte sektionsleder Mette Myhre Johnsen på telefon 91 36 57 09. Generel information om politiet kan findes på www.politi.dk.

Når du søger en stilling i politiet opretter du samtidig en profil i vores rekrutteringssystem. Hvis du søger flere jobs i politiet, skal du lægge en ansøgning og et CV ind i systemet pr. ansøgt job. Du skal derfor ikke slette tidligere dokumenter, hvis du søger endnu et job. Det er først, hvis du har fået afslag på en søgt stilling, at du kan slette dokumenterne knyttet dertil. Vi anbefaler, at du navngiver dine dokumenter, så det fremgår, hvilket job du søger. Foruden ansøgning og CV, bedes du uploade dit eksamensbevis. Du skal uploade alle dokumenter i pdf-format.

Vi opfordrer alle interesserede til at søge stillingen uanset alder, køn, religion eller etnisk tilhørsforhold.

Vi forventer at afholde samtaler i uge 45.

Det er en tidsbegrænset stilling til udgangen af 2024 med opstart hurtigst muligt.

Ansøgningsfrist: 30. oktober 2023

Web Operations Specialist (DK),"Lenus · Copenhagen, Capital Region, Denmark  1 day ago  · 1 applicant","About the job
Lenus is looking for a Web Operations Specialist (DK)

Do you love making a difference and helping your colleagues and clients every day flexing your knowledge of 'web alien language', as one of our non-tech-savvy colleagues calls it? Are you brave enough to challenge the status quo, come up with alternatives, and follow them through to implementation and distribution and fuel our ever-changing machine? Then join our mission to help Lenus onboard new amazing partners and deliver the best web support there is!

Join our team of Web Operations Specialists at our HQ in Copenhagen. You will be our third Web Operations specialist in Copenhagen but will work just as closely with a colleague in New York.

Join the health revolution!

At Lenus we are fundamentally energised by our shared vision: making the world a healthier and happier place. Could you see yourself working for a great purpose in a dynamic, global culture? Then we might be a great match.

Who are we looking for:

Our next WebOps Specialist: 

Has a 'Can-Do' mindset and is eager to learn new things. 
Is comfortable working in a very fast-paced environment where everyone is able to inflict change and adapt to it rapidly. 
Is keen on taking ownership and responsibility, as well as being able to acknowledge when they make a mistake. 
Has a customer-service mindset and is able to find out what the customer actually needs even though they are asking for something else. 
Has an ability to follow our standards, checklists, and guides, as well as suggest improvements and implement them. 
Have a feeling for aesthetics and design and is able to build upon an already established visual identity. 
Is able to spot mistakes, fix them, and teach their peers how to avoid them in the future. 

Most importantly, you are a fun person to be around who can take a joke and give one back. We highly cherish our team culture and atmosphere (as well as our emoji packs of each team member... yes, you are getting one too).

Responsibilities

So, what is it like to work as a Web Operations Specialist at Lenus? The role is focused on three areas:

 Coach Onboarding

As Web Operations Tech Specialist, you onboard coaches deploying a hard-coded website with a Robotic Process Automation (RPA). That particular process consists of editing variables in a JavaScript file and adjusting the design of the final website. We are also responsible for the RPA itself and the design templates used in it.

 Website Support and Maintenance

Through our ticketing system, we receive requests for changes on over 500+ WordPress websites, as well as a growing number of hard-coded websites deployed with the RPA. Our job is to prioritize them and action them within a given timeline. The requests range from simple text and image changes to implementation of new functionalities, domain migrations or troubleshooting of bugs etc. Here our versatility and ability to understand the goal of our coaches really come into play! When it comes to maintenance, we need to ensure all of our websites have the highest maximum uptime and minimize the grounds for rendering our coaches' websites unusable. That includes making sure all our WordPress plugins' versions will not result in mismatches and potential issues down the road.

 Tertiary Areas

Last but not least, we are making sure all our websites are meeting high-quality standards as well as legal requirements with regard to cookies, GDPR, and local legislation across all markets in which we operate. That often requires us to coordinate with multiple different departments such as Web Design, Conversion Rate Optimisation, Legal, Marketing, Product, and Sales.

TLDR; we are octopuses when it comes to the world of the web. Jack of all trades but masters of none. We onboard, we support, we optimize. We ensure the success of our coaches in the online domain. As we are a rapidly growing organization, our process changes on a monthly, if not weekly, basis. It is therefore necessary for us to be flexible and adaptable to the organization's needs. In the team, we take that as an opportunity to grow and learn new things!

Qualifications:

Front-end code — HTML and CSS are used on a daily basis, and knowledge of JavaScript is beneficial. 
WordPress and Elementor or a similar page builder. 
Web development in general and knowledge of DNS. 
Adobe Creative Suite (namely Photoshop, After Effects, XD, and Illustrator), is not a requirement but a plus. 
Familiarity and/or interest in marketing, CRO, and branding principles are a plus, as you will be part of our commercial organization and your input can make a real difference for our coaches' ability to grow their business. 
""We encourage you to apply even if you don't tick all the boxes""

The Team:

Aside from the opportunity to work with incredibly talented people who are fun to be around, joining the WebOps team means being a part of a team where positive vibes are constant and no two days are alike. Though we value the headspace to get things done, we genuinely enjoy spending time with each other. Currently, we have 2 specialists and a Team Lead in Copenhagen, and one WebOps specialist in New York. The team has a diverse background and thus able to contribute with expertise and knowledge covering our multifaceted work. The full WebOps team gather once a day to check-in, debrief and plan for the coming day/week. This keeps us aligned across timezones.

Benefits & Perks

A competitive salary
A Macbook and other hardware to support you in your daily work
Development feedback cycles with quarterly check-ins
The culture - being recognised when you walk into the office. Your colleagues genuinely care about you
Team events and monthly social events in all our offices
Focus on mental well-being with our team wellness workshops and in-house Mindful Mondays session
Delicious office snacks and drinks

We'll be going through applications frequently, so if this sounds like a great opportunity for you, hit apply and our talent team will go through it and be in touch with you.

We look forward to reading your application.

Postdocs in Journalism Studies / Media Management,"Roskilde University · Roskilde, Zealand, Denmark  1 week ago  · 5 applicants","About the job
This job is sourced from a job board. Learn More
The Department of Communication and Arts (DCA), Roskilde University, invites applications for two postdoc positions. The positions begin on February 1, 2024, or as soon as possible thereafter and runs for 24-30 months. The purpose of the positions is to study the effect of data on journalistic practice and output.

The Department of Communication and Arts

Your daily workplace will be Department of Communication and Arts at Roskilde University. DCA covers RUC’s Communication programs (Communication, Journalism, and Performance Design) and Art programs (Danish, Philosophy, History, and Cultural Encounters).

We conduct excellent, interdisciplinary research in the intersection between Communication, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Humanities, and offer an innovative and interdisciplinary university environment, characterized by diversity with respect to theory, method, and area of study in research and education. Our research is characterized by double impact, i.e. by the highest academic quality, and by a direct interaction with public, private and civil actors in the society.

We have strong research networks and partnerships with local, regional, national, and international partners with the goal of ensuring the highest quality in all our research-based activities.

Descriptions Of The Postdoc Projects

The two postdoc positions are linked to the research project “The Datafied News Industry” (DANI), which is funded by the Velux Foundation and runs 2024-2027 (https://www.DatafiedNewsIndustry.org ). The project is located at the Department of Communication and Arts at Roskilde University, where it is associated with the Journalism and Democracy research group, the Center for News Research, and the Digital Media Lab. The project is a core group of five researchers (both junior and senior), each of whom work on integrated subprojects, so the successful applicants will work closely together with project leader Associate Professor Aske Kammer, an international visiting professor, each other, and a PhD student.

The DANI project explores how the news industry collects, understands, and uses data as a strategic resource across different organizational and institutional spaces or contexts (newsrooms, development departments, sales and marketing, management, and in relation to external actors). The main empirical focus is on the Danish news industry, but other countries may be included for comparative reasons (dependent on the successful applicant’s own research interests).

The first postdoc will contribute to the DANI project by researching the use of data in the development and operation of paywalls on news websites. As the technical systems for paywalls are different from organization to organization, and as some are off-the-shelf solutions while other are “homemade”, an infrastructural perspective that also scrutinizes software documentation is welcome (but not mandatory) for this position.

The second postdoc will contribute to the DANI project by researching how data is used in the development and operation of AI, automation, and/or recommender systems inside news organizations. To peek inside the algorithmic “black boxes” that select and publicly distribute information, the postdoc should explore which types of data are used in these connections, how they are collected, structured, and prioritized, and how the involved human actors understand and negotiate their importance.

One of the postdocs will be employed for additionally six months to build a database of all digital news offerings (websites and apps) in Denmark. This database must also include structural data about, for example, ownership, reach, and revenue models, so familiarity with the Danish news industry is considered a strong asset in this connection. This task must be conducted as early as possible in the period of employment. All applicants must state in their application whether they would be interested in having this task added to their postdoc.

Qualifications

Applicants must hold a PhD or the equivalent within media and communication studies, journalism studies, media management, or an adjacent field in the humanities, social sciences or data sciences.

The ideal candidates are excellent scholars with experience in empirical research and an expertise in qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies. Furthermore, the ideal candidates understand how digital technology works and are familiar (or ready to immediately familiarize themselves) with current developments at the intersection of journalism studies, media management research, and data science.

The Ideal Candidates Are Furthermore Expected To Demonstrate
Good collaborativeskills.
A track-record of publishing in leading international journals within the field.
Good command of Danish or English is necessary. Good command of Danish is considered an asset. Experience in publishing in English is also considered an asset.
Questions

For further information about the position or to obtain a full academic description of the project, please contact PI, Associate Professor Aske Kammer on askek@ruc.dk.

At Nango (YC W23), we've developed an open-source platform dedicated to product integrations. It's a developer tool crafted by engineers, for engineers, seamlessly connecting software solutions.

We're in search of a founding engineer who possesses significant experience in backend development and is keen on profoundly impacting other developers' lives. By joining us, you'll be collaborating intimately with our two founders across all facets of our startup. Not to mention, you'll be stepping into a well-funded, seed stage startup environment.

Collaborate directly with founders on product and company strategy.
Oversee our widely-recognized open-source repository and engage with its community.
Support customers and open-source contributors alike.
Drive engineering best practices and make key technology decisions.
As Nango expands, recruit and lead a top-tier engineering team.
Acquire the expertise needed to kickstart a dev-tool startup.

We're looking for

Exhibit extreme ownership, unparalleled work ethic, and a dedication to challenging the norm to elevate standards.
Communicate and collaborate effectively in a remote setting with excellent English proficiency.
Bring 5+ years of experience in backend engineering to the table.
Possess in-depth knowledge of scaling complex backend architectures.
Have a genuine enthusiasm for crafting developer tools.
Showcase empathy for users and an instinct for optimizing Developer Experience (DX).
Embrace a collaborative spirit and embody an ally mentality, essential for thriving in a tight-knit, agile team.

Github: 3200+ stars, 90+ contributors Community members: 600+ Supported integrations: 120+ Funding: $2M

Product

Nango simplifies the process for engineers to integrate their software with external APIs. Our open-source platform acts as a one-stop solution for all product integrations.

Despite companies investing $2B annually in creating product integrations, they often miss out on significant revenue due to the absence of crucial integrations. With Nango, businesses can integrate once and immediately tap into a suite of 120+ integrations. This not only saves on engineering expenses but also captures more opportunities and wins deals.

There's a growing trend towards enhancing software products with integrations, especially among LLM apps that require data imports from external systems."

Production Supervisor (Relocate to Malta),Magro Brothers · Denmark  1 week ago  · 17 applicants,"About the job
Magro Brothers Group of Companies is a private, family-owned organisation. It finds its roots in 1916 when three Magro brothers joined their father`s business as general provisions merchants.

In 1934 they ventured in the processing and canning of fresh tomatoes and subsequently branched into a number of other business activities including the importation into Malta of livestock, fodder and foodstuffs and exports of local agricultural produce.

In 1977, John and Michael Magro, the sons of one of the first partners, took over the running of the business and further expanded their activities to include tinplate can manufacture, food distribution, retailing, advertising & marketing, property development.

In 1995, the company moved to a purposely built factory with a covered area of 27,000 square metres which today has become a centre of excellence for food processing in the Mediterranean.

In December 2013, John and Michael, being the 3rd generation in the Magro Brothers business enterprise, transferred their shares to John’s children namely, Christian, Nicholas and Joanna. Christian was appointed C.E.O. of the Group in January 2018 while John remains chairman of the Group and Michael continues to form part of the main board of directors.

The backbone of the food sector of Magro Brothers Group of Companies is still the processing of fresh tomatoes – Magro Brothers (Foods) Ltd is the major company within the group. It is one of the few local companies which handle the whole production cycle of tomato related products, from the growing of crops to the distribution of the finished product. This also includes the production of tinplate-cans. The present production range is very diversified and includes canned tomatoes, table and pasta sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise and other condiments, thin sauces, jams and ready-to-eat jellies.

The company is also well established in several overseas markets with sales offices in UK and Ireland supplying high profile international brands. Presently the company exports some 45% of its production to 20 countries spread in four continents.

In 2004, as part of the company’s policy of diversification and living up to market expectations, Magro Brothers Group expanded their business to offer exclusive gifting and hampers of Maltese delicacies and crafts under the Savina Brand and, in 2010 they ventured also in the production of traditional Maltese cheeses and dairy products under the popular Hanini Brand.

Today, with over 100 years’ experience, Magro Brothers Group of Companies has become one of the leading enterprises in Malta and has gained the respect of the local business community and the trust of most financial and commercial organisations. The owners take pride into rigorously monitoring the crops and herds of the many Maltese and Gozitan farmers who regularly supply fresh agricultural produce and milk to their organisation. This has helped the company to achieve the well-deserved premier position in food processing in Malta.

The company is very proud of its Quality credentials and boasts a BRC Grade AA food safety certification, an Organic certification and ISO 22000. They offer brand owners a wealth of manufacturing expertise and specialize in private label. Currently they supply their products to various multinational brand owners around the world and in major retail outlets.

Så er Fellowmind en oplagt mulighed for det næste skridt i din karriere!
Hos Fellowmind søger vi konsulenter til vores Data & Analytics Team. I Data & Analytics arbejder vi passioneret med hele Microsoft stacken for at skabe de bedste Business Intelligence oplevelser for vores kunder. Vi arbejder sammen både i huset og i teamet – og vil gerne have dig med.

Inspirere og vise mulighederne ved brug af data og Business Intelligence.
Sikre, at vores kunder får det maksimale ud af deres løsninger.
Skabe forandring og tage ejerskab for dette.
Sætte dit eget præg på vores Best Practice.
Om teamet
I vores team synes vi vitterligt, at konceptet BI er det bedste, der er sket i forretningsverden, siden man begyndte at gemme og indsamle data. Vi fokuserer på høj faglighed, innovative løsninger og i særdeleshed kundetilfredshed, og vi ønsker at vækste teamet med profiler, der kan være med til at sætte Fellowminds Data & Analytics team på landkortet.
Teamet dækker bredt, og vores erfaring og kompetencer spænder lige fra behovsanalyse, kildeintegration over ETL og data warehousing, til front-end design og implementering.
Om dit kommende job
Som Business Intelligence Konsulent kommer du til at indgå i Data & Analytics teamet. Du vil lige fra starten få direkte kundekontakt og vil ofte indgå i hele projektforløbet fra salg til implementering.
Fellowmind er eksperter indenfor Microsoft-teknologi, og du kan derfor forvente, at projekterne baseres helt eller delvist på Microsofts BI suite. Du vil som konsulent inden for Business Intelligence oftest arbejde med den nyeste teknologi, og det vil være positivt, hvis du, sideløbende og i samspil med kundeprojekter, afprøver og udfordrer nye teknologier og tiltag.
Du får en unik mulighed for at fokusere på at udvikle og implementere BI-løsninger i samspil med vores mange dygtige specialister og forretningskonsulenter indenfor bl.a. Dynamics 365, Office 365, SharePoint og PPM.
Om dine faglige kompetencer
Vi forestiller os, at du kommer fra en stilling som BI Konsulent eller som Intern BI Konsulent, men der kan være flere indgange til stillingen.
Alt afhængig af dit erfaringsniveau, har du formentlig gennemført flere data warehouse- og BI-projekter med succes. Det er en fordel, hvis du har indsigt i områder som projektledelse, lager- & ressourcestyring, økonomi, produktion, m.m., og det er ligeledes en fordel, hvis du har erfaring med datakilder som Microsoft Dynamics 365 (CRM, AX), Nav, SAP eller andre kilder med økonomi, løn, tidsregistrerings- eller sags- og dokumentstyringsdata. Vi ser desuden gerne, at du mestrer Power BI og Tabular data modellering eller har interesse i at lære dette.
Vi forventer, at du har kendskab til og erfaring med størstedelen af følgende:
Teknologiske platforme
Microsoft SQL Server
Azure Data Platform
Azure Synapse og / eller Azure Data Factory
Microsoft Fabric
Tabular data modellering
Power BI
ETL / ELT
Formidling af tekniske emner til mindre tech-kyndige personer
Om dine personlige kompetencer
Vi ser gerne, at du:
er samarbejdsvillig, imødekommende, initiativrig
er god til at netværke både internt såvel som eksternt
ikke er bange for at gå forrest i opgaveløsningen
har fokus på at levere kvalitet og opfylde kundens forventninger indenfor budget
stiller høje krav til dig selv, og ikke er bange for at forvente det samme af dine omgivelser
er nysgerrig på andre teknologier og forretningsområder og hvordan en samlet Microsoft platform kan hjælpe med at skabe mere heltænkte løsninger.
Derudover er gode danskkundskaber en forudsætning for denne stilling.

Forretningsspecialister med god dataindsigt til Digital Solution,"ATP · Hillerød, Capital Region, Denmark  1 week ago  · 1 applicant","About the job
Kan du analysere forretningsbehov, specificere krav og omsætte viden til løsninger? Vil du arbejde med landets mest interessante datagrundlag og være med til at sikre, at velfærdsydelser havner i de rigtige lommer? Så er du en af de forretningsspecialister, vi søger. 
Vil du udvikle løsninger til gavn for samfundet?
I ATP's dataområde er vi på udkig efter nye kolleger til rollen som forretningsspecialist, der kan analysere forretningens behov, kravspecificere nye IT-løsninger og optimere eksisterende. Du har solide datakundskaber og bliver en del af Data Governance, hvor vi bidrager til dagsordenen for arbejdet med data og kvalitet i ATP.

Vi omsætter data og tværgående viden om forretningen til løsninger og processer, der i sidste ende gør det nemt at være borger og virksomhed i Danmark. Det er det, vi er gode til, og dét, du skal hjælpe os med. 

I jobbet kommer du ikke til at programmere. Det er der andre, der klarer. Men du kommer til at være specialisten, der:



forstår processer og omsætter lovgivning til forretningsregler

udarbejder konsekvensanalyser og kommunikerer ændringer og driftsfejl

optimerer udnyttelse af den forretningsmæssige brug af data på tværs af organisationen

forstår og anvender komplekse datamodeller.



Vi forventer ikke, at du kan det hele på forhånd, og vi sørger selvfølgelig for en god og grundig oplæring.

Kan du se tingene i en større sammenhæng?
Måske kommer du med en uddannelsesbaggrund som fx cand.polit., cand.oecon. eller tilsvarende, men det er ikke et krav. Kort fortalt kan der være flere indgange til jobbet.

Det vigtigste er, at du:



kan se tingene i et større perspektiv

har tjek på SQL, R eller Python

har kendskab til datamodeller, regelmodellering og/eller kravspecifikationer

har lyst til at arbejde i et udviklingsmiljø, hvor tingene går stærkt

vil varetage en funktion, hvor du samarbejder med kolleger fra mange forskellige områder i organisationen.



Vil du arbejde for den økonomiske grundtryghed i Danmark?
Som den del af teamet Data Governance får du et spændende job i et område, hvor vi er mange fagligheder, der skærper datakvaliteten og fx også er ansvarlige for kontroller og afstemninger af pengestrømmene i ATP. Det betyder, at vi til enhver tid kan forklare, hvor i systemet pengene er.

Du vil få en bred berøringsflade med kolleger fra andre dele af ATP, fordi vi til daglig arbejder på en af vores mange ordninger ude i forretningen. Vi er samlet om fredagen, hvor vi styrker vores faglige fundament og videndeler på tværs af de ordninger, vi hver især arbejder med. 

Som vores nye kollega i Data Governance bliver du også en del af området Digital Solutions i ATP.

PhD in The Digital Society and Trust with Focus on Trust in Online Service Providers,"Roskilde University · Roskilde, Zealand, Denmark  1 week ago  · 2 applicants","About the job
This job is sourced from a job board. Learn More
The Department of Communication and Arts (DCA), Roskilde University, invites applications for a salaried PhD position studying trust in digital service providers from 1 February 2024. The position as PhD fellow is limited to 3 years of full-time employment with DCA as the daily workplace.

Department of Communication and Arts

Your daily workplace will be Departement of Communication and Arts at Roskilde University. DCA covers RUC’s Communication programs (Communication, Journalism, and Performance Design) and Art programs (Danish, Philosophy, History, and Cultural Encounters).

We conduct excellent, interdisciplinary research in the intersection between Communication, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Humanities, and offer an innovative and interdisciplinary university environment, characterized by diversity with respect to theory, method, and area of study in research and education. Our research is characterized by double impact, i.e., by the highest academic quality, and by direct interaction with public, private, and civil actors in society. We have strong research networks and partnerships with local, regional, national, and international partners with the goal of ensuring the highest quality in all our research-based activities.

Description Of The PhD Project

The PhD position is part of the research project Digital Society and Trust (DIS-TRUST) funded by the Velux Foundations. The PhD position is located at Roskilde University, and the successful applicant will be associated with the research group Science Studies and Centre for Digital Citizenship. The successful applicant will work closely with the project leader, Associate Professor Esther Oluffa Pedersen, and other members of the DIS-TRUST project at Roskilde University.

The DIS-TRUST project investigates how conditions for interpersonal trust and trust in institutions change in the digital society, how new forms of trust are formed, and what challenges digitalization poses to trust. The project originates in philosophy’s conceptual work with trust and digitalization. The constant digital transformations of social life worlds are studied conceptually and by confronting the conceptual analyses with concrete context embedded case studies. Consequently, DIS-TRUST advances and matures its analyses of trust oscillating within the poles of qualitative empirical research and philosophical conceptual theories. A brief description of the project can be found here: https://veluxfoundations.dk/da/kernegruppebevillinger-2023.

In alignment with the goals of overall project, we invite original research proposals for a PhD project focusing on how users experience trust in service providers on the Internet. The project has two strains. Firstly, the question what are necessary and sufficient requirements for internet service providers to be trustworthy? For the success of this part, it is crucial to gain context-sensitive insights into how trustworthiness is established in digital environments. Secondly, the PhD project also questions how users (as consumers and citizens) experience trust to providers of services?

Som person forventer vi, at du trives i dialog og samarbejde med andre mennesker, da du vil skulle arbejde sammen med medarbejdere i afdelinger på tværs af både Kultur- og Sundhedsforvaltningen og på tværs af data- og analysemedarbejdere i hele Vejle Kommune.

MES udvikler til Support,"Frontmatec · Stilling, Middle Jutland, Denmark  1 month ago  · 0 applicants","About the job
Drømmer du om at være med til at bygge en helt ny funktion op? Som Frontmatec Control Systems nye MES udvikler i Support, vil du få en unik mulighed for at sætte aftryk og retning for teknisk MES support for vores kunder i fødevareindustrien.

Deltagelse i projekter og hjælpe kunden med at løse deres problemer, det vil som udgangspunkt fylde meget af din arbejdsdag. Det lyder som en kliché, men vi mener det faktisk, når vi siger at ikke to dage er ens som MES udvikler i Support.

Dine primære arbejderopgaver er, at:

Identificere og analysere problemer
Softwareudvikling i C# .NET og SQL database
Deltagelse i projekter og videreudvikling af vores løsninger

MES Support er en helt ny funktion som du skal være med til at udvikle, og sætte standarden for hvordan vi tænker udvikling og support. Du vil have en daglig leder, Support Manager, der kender vore produkter, kunder og organisationen godt og du vil indgå i vores support funktion sammen med Support Manageren. 

Du får et tæt samarbejde med både MES udviklere og projektledere. Typisk vil du møde dem på kontoret i enten Stilling eller Skive. Du vil også kunne arbejde både fra Skive og Stilling, ligesom det kan være en naturlig del at arbejde hjemme fra nogle dage om ugen. 

For at få succes i rollen, skal du bruge dine analytiske evner til at grave dig ned i kundens problemstilling, lytte og stille opklarende spørgsmål. Du skal gå i dialog, søge løsninger og være teknisk nysgerrig.

Når en kunde kontakter dig, er det ofte fordi der er opstået et, for dem akut problem, du skal evne at forstå og identificere problemets omfang, holde hovedet koldt, og søge sparring med dine kolleger. 

Support vil fylde en mindre del af din hverdag, og du vil derfor bruge det meste af din tid på at deltage i projekter, men typisk projekter med kortere horisont.

MES er laget, der forener maskin- og produktionsplanlægning. Med MES overføres ordrer automatisk til produktionsudstyret, mens materialeforbrug, og antallet af producerede varer rapporteres tilbage til virksomhedens ERP-system. Vores MES-løsninger giver kunden et overblik over deres produktion i realtid og evnen til at styre flere elementer i produktionsprocessen. For eksempel overføres ordrer automatisk til produktionsudstyret, mens materialeforbruget, og antallet af producerede varer rapporteres tilbage til ERP-systemet.

Frontmatec Control Systems er en del af Frontmatec koncernen, hvor vores fokus er på tekniske løsninger, og dette job er i vores afdeling for Food MES. I Frontmatec Control Systems er vi 140 ansatte, og heraf arbejder 22 dedikeret med MES til fødevareindustrien.

Hos os vil du opleve fleksibilitet, og en stor tillid til dine personlige evner til at komme bedst muligt i mål med dine opgaver. Din leder er spillende træner og vil deltage i det daglige arbejde, være der til at guide, udfordre og bakke dig op. Dine nærmeste kolleger vil være klar med erfaring, hjælp og dårlige jokes. I arbejder tæt sammen med øvrige kolleger der primært arbejder med SW udvikling. Uanset hvem du møder i huset, vil du opleve at dine kolleger er dedikerede og fagligt skarpe. At være ny vil være problemfrit, for snakken er uformel og alle er klar til at hjælpe med at finde vej i snirklede gange.

Send os dit CV, hvor du viser din erfaring og et par ord om hvem du er. Vi læser dit skriv så snart vi har modtaget det, så send den hurtigst muligt. 

Om Frontmatec Control Systems

Frontmatec Control Systems er en del af Frontmatec koncernen. Frontmatec Control Systems dækker over gruppens løsninger inden for MES, industriel IT, SCADA og automationsløsninger.

Vi leder efter en Customer Support Agent til vores kundesupport. Sammen med dine kollegaer på vores supporthold kommer du til at hjælpe vores kunder og partnere, når de henvender sig via chat, telefon eller email. Din fornemste opgave er at give dem en fantastisk service og hurtigt og effektivt at afhjælpe deres problem.

Lidt om os…

Det er egentligt ret nemt. Corpay One er sat i verden for at fuldautomatisere virksomheders fakturaflow. Dét gør vi med en af markedets førende bilagsscannere, intelligente godkendelsesflows og netbanksfri betalinger. Corpay One blev startet i 2016 og opkøbt i 2021 af amerikanske Fleetcor. Og mens vores muskler er vokset, så er vores dynamiske, ambitiøse og uformelle mentalitet forblevet den samme.

Jobbet

Det vigtigste i denne rolle er altid at yde en service i absolut verdensklasse og møde kunderne med god energi og overskud. Vi skal nok sørge for, at du får lært alt det tekniske, også selvom du ikke har arbejdet med software før. Ud over at håndtere henvendelser fra kunderne, vil du skulle tænke proaktivt og selv række ud til kunderne for at forebygge eventuelle udfordringer.

Vores kunder er det absolut vigtigste i vores forretning, og derfor stræber vi hele tiden efter at give dem den bedst mulige service. Selvom det måske ikke er alle, som finder fakturabetaling og bogholderi ophidsende, vil du som Corpay Ones ansigt udadtil komme til at spille en helt afgørende rolle i at give vores brugere en positiv og gnidningsfri oplevelse med vores produkt.

Vi er ved at tage de første spæde skridt mod at lancere Corpay One på UK-markedet. Du vil derfor komme til at supportere en blanding af nye og eksisterende danske og engelske kunder.

Det forventer vi af dig

Først og fremmest skal du elske at tale med kunder. Du har en serviceminded indstilling, og du går til kunderne med smil og venlighed. 
Du er tålmodig. Du giver ikke op, før kunden har fået løst deres problem. 
Du holder af at løse problemer, og du finder tilfredshed i at hjælpe kunderne med deres udfordringer. 
Er du struktureret, er det en stor fordel. Du vil have mange sager åbne på én gang, så det er vigtigt, at du kan bevare overblikket. 
Du er social og holder af at omgås mennesker. Vi har et stærkt sammenhold, som vi forventer, at du bidrager til. 
Du bliver ikke skræmt af at lære nye IT-programmer at kende. Vi bruger mange forskellige platforme, herunder Slack, Intercom og Jira
Du skriver og taler flydende dansk og engelsk (sidstnævnte til professionel brug)

Det kan du forvente af os

En uformel, men professionnel kultur, hvor vi gør os umage, når vi går på job, men har det sjovt samtidigt. 
En startup-mentalitet, hvor vi hjælper hinanden og ikke er bange for at prøve ting af
Fleksibilitet til at kunne arbejde hjemmefra efter aftale. Dog er du på kontoret, indtil du er mere eller mindre selvkørende. 
God placering i København NV tæt på Metro og S-tog. 

Hvis jobbet lyder som noget for dig, så tøv ikke med at ansøge. Vi indkalder løbende kandidater til samtale og ansætter, når vi har fundet den rette.

Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig!

Som arbejdsgiver ønsker vi hos Corpay One at give lige muligheder til alle ansøgere. Vi stræber efter at opretholde og udvikle vores inkluderende arbejdsmiljø og byder medlemmer af alle baggrunde og perspektiver velkommen."

Resolve technical discussions and manage the technical quality of team deliverables. Promote collaboration and engagement within the team and across the whole organization while building solid relationships with all relevant stakeholders.

Be curious and keen on learning, and we will support you to grow to where you would like to go. It is okay not to know everything, as long as you want to learn.

You will:

Enable the engineering team to deliver product functionality in a modern language
Set your vision and build it together with the team
Evolve our product by evolving our architecture and services
Mentor and coach the rest of the team
Shape how we work
Resolve technical discussions

Project(s)

We want to enable more people on our engineering team to extend the backend part of the product, and deliver product functionality faster. If you are now thinking “technical debt,” you are correct. We have a dependency on a code base using Tcl (the programming language, pronounced as “tickle”) which has been slowing us down, and we would like to fix that.

We want to do that by transitioning our backend from Tcl to $language. While we have a weak preference for $language to be Go, we are open to change, and it will be up to you to choose $language.

Get an understanding of the product, set the technical vision on how to move away from Tcl and build this vision with the team.

The Tech

Our tech stack has evolved significantly over the years. While Tcl has been the backbone of our codebase, now it’s time for the next step—move to $language, replacing our Tcl, Node.js, and Python services. While we have done some experiments with Go, we will rely on you to choose the $language to go with. This pivotal shift provides an excellent opportunity to be part of a dynamic, learning-centric journey.

We generally run with a flavor of DevOps culture with a platform/SRE team being responsible for the platform and helping the rest of the team with taking care of our production deployments.

We take pride in our platform, and we keep iterating on it. At the moment we run in AWS and on top of Kubernetes. We store data in Postgresql, Redis and S3 and exchange messages via RabbitMQ.

What Success Looks Like

The engineering team can deliver product functionality in a modern language
We have a shared vision for where is our tech going
The team is learning from you

To Apply

When applying, please upload your resume, and a short, genuinely human cover letter will help you.

Benefits

The role has a competitive salary with three months fully paid parental leave, & five weeks of paid vacation.

You will participate in the company bonus scheme “The Pool” based on salary ratio/employment time in the year.

Probably the best office in Copenhagen, situated right next to the Lakes in the center of Copenhagen.

We will supply a computer, paid phone, free lunch (as far as the Danish government allows it), and all the coffee, juice, beer and wine in the office you can drink."

CO2 is a global problem. By fermenting it into carbon negative chemicals, we make it the solution.

If that doesn’t bubble your bioreactor, how about this: For every tonne of products we make, over 2 tonnes of carbon are removed from the atmosphere.

Vi søger en lærer, der vil træde ind i et vikariat med dansk, engelsk og historie på mellemtrinnet på Beder Skole. Vi kender ikke helt tidshorisonten på vikariatet, men forventeligt vil det løbe minimum tre måneder, og vi vil være i løbende dialog om vikariatets længde (stillingen er begivenhedsbestemt).

Stillingen er på 80 %. I skemaet har du fri fredag og har en kort dag tirsdag (fri til middag). Lektionerne er dansk og engelsk i en 4. kl., engelsk og historie i en anden 4. kl., historie i to 5. klasser samt madkundskab på 5. årgang – her vil du få hjælp af en co-teacher, så du kommer godt i gang i faget. Du skal også samarbejde med en co-teacher i nogle af de andre lektioner.

Din Profil

Du er læreruddannet evt. med linjefag i dansk, engelsk og/eller historie
Du har lyst til at arbejde med børnenes forskellige tilgange til og muligheder i læringsfællesskaber 
Du er opsat på at samarbejde i et professionelt læringsfælleskab med både lærere, pædagoger og forældre
Du ser dig selv ind i arbejdet med, at alle børn føler sig anerkendt for de forskellige kompetencer, de møder skolen med. 
Du vil arbejde med, at alle møder passende udfordringer både fagligt og socialt

Vi arbejder med både børnenes og de voksnes forpligtende fællesskab og ser relationskompetence som en vigtig del af skolens virke.

På Beder Skole står vi på tre værdier. Det vil du mærke og skulle arbejde med: det er forpligtende fællesskaber, livsduelighed og udsyn.

Vi ser diversitet som en styrke, og vi ser børn som mere ens end forskellige. I sommeren 2021 startede vi som NEST-skole, hvilket har afsmittende virkning på skolens udvikling og vores tænkning. Vi møder hinanden med tillid og respekt. Der er plads til humor, og skolelivets udfordringer løser vi sammen, både lærere, forældre, elever og ledelse.

Om os

På Beder skole træder du ind i et stærkt læringsfælleskab. Vi er optagede af at skabe muligheder for, at de voksne kan lave de bedst mulige rammer for børns trivsel og læring. Derfor arbejder vi målrettet med tilgange i undervisning og pædagogik, så alle børn oplever tilgængelige og motiverende fællesskaber.

Dygtig konsulent med sort bælte i data,"Vejle Kommune · Vejle, South Denmark, Denmark  2 weeks ago  · 3 applicants","About the job
til den Centrale Budgetafdeling i Vejle Kommune
Vejle Kommune er i fuld fart fremad. Vi arbejder med effektiviseringer på en måde, som både gavner den daglige opgaveløsning og organisationen som helhed. I den forbindelse søger vi en datakonsulent, som vil være med til at udvikle digitale redskaber og fremme en dataunderstøttet styring.

Om jobbet

Vi søger en skarp kollega, som kan være med til at understøtte de digitale redskaber ind i vores arbejde. Du skal hjælpe os med at drible videre med de projekter og opgaver, der flyver ind i vores team, ved bl.a. at dyrke data og høste tallene til et visuelt og tiltalende format samt følge op på aktiviteter og effekter. Du vil både arbejde i parløb og selvstændigt - afhængig af den opgave, der lander på dit bord. Det handler fx om at omsætte data til KPI’er så vi får det gode overblik og en bedre styring.

Stillingen er placeret i det Centrale Budget Team, som er et team, der har mangeartede opgaver fx indenfor budget-og økonomistyring, analyse, projektledelse, facilitering og optimering. Medarbejderne har forskellige uddannelsesmæssige baggrunde, og det giver et dynamisk arbejdsfællesskab, hvor vi kan supplere hinandens kompetencer. Du vil blive en del af et team, hvor vi deler udfordringer med hinanden og hvor vi vil høre, hvad du har lavet i weekenden. Vi sætter også pris på metodefrihed i opgaveløsningen.

Du vil blive en nøgleperson inden for digitale redskaber og du kan forvente, at dine bidrag vil blive en vigtig del af såvel den daglige drift, som det strategiske perspektiv. Du vil få en aktiv rolle som tovholder i udviklingen af digitale værktøjer. Du vil desuden blive en del af vores projekt omkring procesoptimering og arbejdsgangsanalyser, som skal sikre smartere veje til målet, mindre bureaukrati og mere tid til kerneopgaven.

I vores daglige arbejde anvender vi en lang række digitale redskaber, VBA, Power BI, RPA, mv. Vi har derfor brug for en, der ikke er bange for at jonglere med data, og som er interesseret i kodning og kan bruge det til at skabe smutveje igennem arbejdet. Samtidig skal du være bevidst om, at data ikke kan stå alene – og at anvendelse og kontekst er afgørende for at få værdi.

Om dig

Du har en relevant videregående uddannelse, og kan genkende dig selv i nedenstående:
Er drevet af at gøre en forskel
Er analytisk, nysgerrig og kritisk i tilgangen
Er ambitiøs og visionær, og har lyst til at skabe forbedringer og tør gå nye veje
Kan sætte dig hurtigt ind i komplekse emner, som du formår at formidle på en letforståelig måde

About PostHog

PostHog helps engineers build better products. We are a single platform to analyze, test, observe, and deploy new features. We give engineers product analytics, session recording, feature flags, A/B testing, event pipelines, SQL access and a data warehouse… and there’s plenty more to come.

PostHog was created as an open source project during Y Combinator's W20 cohort and had the most successful B2B software launch on HackerNews since 2012 - with a product that was just 4 weeks old. Since then, more than 35,000 companies have installed the platform. We've had huge success with our paid upgrades, raised $27m from some of the world's top investors, and have shown strong product-led growth - 97% driven by word of mouth.

Despite the 📉 tech market, we're default alive and doing better than ever!

PostHog makes money from our cloud product, or people can self host the open source project. We average 10% monthly revenue growth and are aiming for $10m ARR in early 2024. While others are focused on layoffs and struggling to grow into huge valuations, we're focusing on an awesome product for end users, hiring a handful of exceptional team members and seeing fantastic increases in revenue as a result.

What We Value
We are open source - building a huge community around a free-for-life product is key to PostHog's strategy. 
We aim to become the most transparent company, ever. In order to enable teams to make great decisions, we share as much information as we can. In our public handbook everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, what our strategy is, and who we have raised money from. 
Working autonomously and maximizing impact - we don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what is going to have the biggest impact on our customers. 
Solving big problems - we haven't built our defining feature yet. We are all about shipping fast, talking to users, and iterating. 

What You’ll Be Doing

You’ll have the opportunity to work on huge data challenges (we peak at 1m events/minute and process billions of events) while leading a team of seasoned and smart engineers. You will have incredibly high autonomy and work closely with our customers, who are also engineers. More specifically:
You'll work closely with the team to plan long-term goals on how to scale the ingestion and export pipeline. 
We've had such a large increase in event scale, we need to re-design how we do ingestion to future proof for the next couple of years, when we'll repeat this (else we'd be over-engineering by definition). 
Maintain a high bar for the team’s quality of work and performance (i.e. incident reviews, stand-ups, etc.) 
Ship a bunch of code! 

Requirements
Strong product knowledge with some infrastructure and/or data experience
High ownership, ability to drive big complex products to completion
Some leadership experience (this is still mostly a shipping role)
Proven ability to lead big projects to completion

Nice to have
Node/typescript experience
Comfortable running incidents

If this sounds like what you’d love to be doing, we can’t wait to hear from you. If you’re not sure that you exactly fit the above criteria, get in touch anyway. Alignment with our values is just as important as experience! 🙏

Benefits

What we offer in return:
💰 Generous, transparent compensation and employee-friendly equity in PostHog
🌴 Unlimited time off with a 25 day minimum (in 2021 the team on average took 32 days off)
🏥 Private medical insurance, including dental and vision (US and UK only)
👵 👴 Pension/401k contributions (4% matching)
🍼 Generous parental, bereavement and child loss leave
📕 Training budget and free books
☕ $200/month budget towards co-working or café working and $500/month for team socials
🧠 Spill mental health chat
🤝 $100/month budget to provide support to open-source projects
💸 We'll be your first investor
🛫 Regular team off-sites (we went to Iceland in March) with carbon offsetting for work travel with Project Wren

We believe people from diverse backgrounds, with different identities and experiences, make our product and our company better. That’s why we dedicated a page in our handbook to diversity and inclusion. No matter your background, we'd love to hear from you!

Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you - we're happy to accommodate!"

Postdoc in Digital Society and Trust-Project with Emphasis on Digitalization,"Roskilde University · Roskilde, Zealand, Denmark  1 week ago  · 5 applicants","About the job
This job is sourced from a job board. Learn More
Postdoc in Digital Society and Trust-Project with Emphasis on Digitalization of Governmental Services

The Department of Communication and Arts (DCA), Roskilde University, invites applications for a position as postdoc from February 1. 2024 or as soon as possible thereafter. The position as postdoc is full-time and limited until October 15, 2025. The purpose of the postdoc is to study citizens’ trust in relation to digitalization of governmental services within the auspices of the research project Digital Society and Trust (DIS-TRUST) funded by the Velux Foundation.

The Department of Communication and Arts

Your daily workplace will be Department of Communication and Arts at Roskilde University. DCA covers RUC’s Communication programs (Communication, Journalism, and Performance Design) and Art programs (Danish, Philosophy, History, and Cultural Encounters).

We conduct excellent, interdisciplinary research in the intersection between Communication, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Humanities, and offer an innovative and interdisciplinary university environment, characterized by diversity with respect to theory, method, and area of study in research and education. Our research is characterized by double impact, i.e. by the highest academic quality, and by a direct interaction with public, private and civil actors in the society.

We have strong research networks and partnerships with local, regional, national, and international partners with the goal of ensuring the highest quality in all our research-based activities.

The Project

The DIS-TRUST project investigates how conditions for interpersonal trust and trust in institutions change in the digital society, how new forms of trust are formed, and what challenges digitalization poses to trust. The project originates in philosophy’s conceptual work with trust and digitalization. The constant digital transformations of social life worlds are studied conceptually and by confronting the conceptual analyses with concrete context embedded case studies. Consequently, DIS-TRUST advances and matures its analyses of trust oscillating within the poles of philosophical conceptual theories and qualitative empirical research. A short description of the project can be found here: https://veluxfoundations.dk/da/kernegruppebevillinger-2023.

The specific research project of the postdoc concerns alterations in trust relations of citizens to governmental institutions due to increased use of digital solutions. The focus will be on digitalization within Danish municipalities. The postdoc is expected to analyze how increased use of digital tools affects citizens’ experience of trust in individual municipality employees, the municipality as an organization and governmental institutions at large. The research to be conducted can include a mixture of philosophical conceptual evaluation, qualitative content analysis of official Danish policy papers from 2019 and onwards, a shorter period of fieldwork at one or two municipalities, and in-depth interviews with citizens and employees from the selected municipality.

Qualifications

Applicants must hold a PhD or the equivalent thereof within philosophy, the history of ideas, science and technology studies, digital communication studies or an adjacent field in the humanities, social sciences or data sciences.

The ideal candidate is an excellent scholar with expertise in modern philosophies of trust, the international research field of epistemic justice and trust, information technology, or digital media studies. The ideal candidate has familiarized her/himself with the intersection between philosophy’s conceptual approach and qualitative empirical research and is enthusiastic about doing research in the methodological meeting of theoretical and empirical qualitative analysis. While prior experience with empirical studies such as fieldwork or qualitative interviews is an asset, it is not required. Candidates without prior experience with qualitative empirical work must describe how the candidate would conceive and carry out the empirical studies. Knowledge of contemporary philosophical research in trust and digitalization, philosophy of law with emphasis on digitalization, and/or epistemic injustice is an asset.

Candidates without such knowledge are expected to describe how they will acquaint themselves with these philosophical perspectives.

Applicants must master spoken and written English at an advanced academic level. Applicants must furthermore be sufficiently fluent in Danish to conduct fieldwork and/or interviews in Danish and read Danish policy papers. Experience of publishing in English will be an asset.

The Applicant Is Furthermore Expected To Demonstrate
Experience with/willingness to organize and conduct research seminars including follow-up evaluations.
An international research-profile including experience of international publication and research dissemination.
Plans for public dissemination of the conducted research.
Terms of employment

The employment is full time, 37 hours per week, and refers to Dean Ida Willig.

Here’s some of our partners that trust our product: Copenhagen Airport, Vestas etc.

The important thing here is that you will become a master of your given domain and you will have a lot of room to experiment on how to get there

Requirements

We expect you to be a fairly independent developer being able to take an idea and turn that into working code, but of course also being able to work in a team is crucial 🔑
We appreciate someone who has the ideal solution in mind but also knows when to take the pragmatic approach
Comfortable with learning new technologies and topics, we're working on tackling new problems throughout the industry and using scalable solutions to do that!

LEADING PROBLEM SOLVING

You’ll identify the root causes of quality issues from the market with support from appropriate teams (such as Product Development, Customer Support, Procurement/Supply Chain and Commercial functions) to evaluate the level of urgency and develop a sequence of corrective actions.

You will be our expert on problem solving methods, like 8D, A3, 5-why and manage our “Quality Issues” Kanban.

You are sharp in math and statistics and that ties together with your analytical thinking. 
You carry a good process understanding, which also makes you great at managing projects. 
You are committed and self-disciplined, which allows you to follow through on complicated issues, even if it might take a while to complete. (Hey, those milestones will be celebrated! 😉)
With the power of words, you are able to convey, summarize and put complex topics into easy-to-consume stories. 
You are structured and methodical - hate it or love it but you know it’s a part of your success!
You are a strong communicator - teams across the organization trust you and follow your incentives. It might be because of your skills in building a compelling argument. 
At some point in your career you’ve most likely worked with hardware product development and manufacturing or made use of external manufacturing partners. 
You’ve ideally worked in a quality function before. 
You could have studied electrical, mechanical or process engineering. (But you might also have chosen an alternative path in your education)

Intrigued? At SOUNDBOKS you’ll find yourself a part of a community. We realize that growth is a process and we don’t expect you to go through it alone. Actually, we guarantee that you won’t have to. We work together in order to work smarter, we inspire each other to be better, and we never forget that every member of the team is responsible for our success.

GDPR Specialist til Norlys,"Norlys · Silkeborg, Middle Jutland, Denmark  3 weeks ago  · 0 applicants","About the job
Jobbet er forankret i koncernens GDPR Center of Excellence, der understøtter, at alle i Norlys kan efterleve GDPR-reglerne. Vi efterlever GDPR på en ensartet måde i vores divisioner og fællesfunktioner, så vi opnår synergier ved at være en koncern.

Vores ambition er at gøre det nemt at være GDPR-compliant i Norlys, og vi involverer organisationen på en sådan måde, at GDPR efterleves som en naturlig del af hverdagen i Norlys. Vi er nytænkende og stræber konstant efter at sikre høj GDPR-compliance på den mest simple måde.

Dine Primære Arbejdsopgaver Vil Være At

Rådgive de forskellige forretningsområder omkring databeskyttelse og vurdering af GDPR-risici
Sparre med projektledere og kollegaer om konkrete GDPR-problemstillinger og mulige løsninger
Understøtte vores Data Protection Officer (DPO) i udarbejdelse af rapporteringer og myndighedssager mv.
Vedligeholde overordnede politikker, procedurer og dokumentation
Rådgive i tilfælde af persondatabrud og bistå ved rapportering
Bidrage til implementering af nye lovgivningsmæssige krav
Bidrage til høj GDPR-awareness og god adfærd relateret til GDPR i Norlys

Du vil indtage en nøglerolle i forbindelse med Norlys’ overholdelse af GDPR, og du får ansvar og opgaver af forskellige kompleksitet, men du er aldrig alene.

Vil du være med til at udbrede Norlys’ GDPR-awareness gennem faglig sparring?

Uddannelsesmæssigt er du fx cand.jur. eller cand.merc.jur. – eller du har en anden uddannelse med fokus på compliance. Du har mere end tre års erhvervserfaring efter endt uddannelse, hvor du kan have arbejdet som advokatfuldmægtig, konsulent, DPO, CISO eller i en anden stilling, hvor compliance, sikkerhed og databeskyttelse er mere end tolkning af paragraffer og artikler.

Du formår at omsætte din viden, så det er forståeligt for både tekniske og ikke-tekniske brugere, der ikke har et lige så indgående kendskab til reglerne som dig. Vi ser gerne, at du har erfaring med GDPR fra en større virksomhed med mange kundedata, men det er ikke et krav.

Øvrige Kvalifikationer

Du er en medspiller, som kan imødekomme forretningens behov og finde gode løsninger inden for de lovgivningsmæssige krav
God forståelse for håndtering af GDPR i praksis og lyst til at forstå Norlys' forskellige forretningsområder og de udfordringer og overvejelser, de har i forhold til GDPR
Du er struktureret og omhyggelig og har en god portion ordenssans, og du forstår at prioritere dine opgaver
Du er selvkørende og initiativrig, og du fungerer godt både selvstændigt og i et team
Du er udadvendt og imødekommende og god til at kommunikere og samarbejde med mange forskellige interessenter på tværs af organisationen

Du bliver en del af noget større!

Vi tilbyder et job i en koncern i rivende udvikling og med et stærkt økonomisk fundament. I Norlys bliver der investeret i medarbejderne, og det betyder, at du altid er i udvikling – både personligt og fagligt. Du kan med andre ord forfølge din karrieredrøm. Din markedsværdi skal stige, og ingen ambitioner er for store eller små. Samtidig vil det være muligt at få ambitioner og arbejdstid til at gå op med fleksibilitet i hverdagen, da det er vigtigt for os at sikre god sammenhæng mellem privatliv og arbejdsliv.

Din primære arbejdsplads vil være i Silkeborg ved vores hovedkontor, dog med rig mulighed for at arbejde hjemmefra eller fra nogle af vores andre lokationer.

Vil du med på rejsen?

Er du interesseret, eller har du spørgsmål til stillingen, så er du velkommen til at kontakte Senior Director Ina Dam, på telefon +45 2482 7108 eller mail inadam@norlys.dk.

Vi har brug for dig snarest muligt, så send os din ansøgning gennem vores online rekrutteringssystem hurtigst muligt, vi forventer at påbegynde samtaler løbende.

a Bit About Axel Arigato

The idea of Axel Arigato started with the founders; Max Svärdh and Albin Johansson, questioning the whole structure of the fashion industry - why and how you make things. By foregoing seasonal collections, traditional sales channels and engaging with customers directly, Axel Arigato was launched with one main objective: to create the present, shape the future, and inspire generations.

At Axel Arigato, our aim is to build a platform through the power of community, inclusivity, and memorable experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value a diverse workforce. We believe that our differences are a strength and that by bringing together our individual perspectives and backgrounds, we make magic happen."

Junior Software Engineer (Swedish) 🇸🇪

Join one of Denmarks fastest growing B2B startups and play a key role in scaling our data solutions across borders.

About Resights 🚀

So if you’ve found your way here, we assume you want to know more about our Junior Software Engineer opportunity right? And you are probably a student or just graduated? Very exciting! But first, maybe we should tell you more about what we do and more importantly, why!

People claim data is the new oil, so why is it soooo time consuming and complicated to work with? 🤯 Data should be accessible and easy to understand. And that is what we are here to do for the real estate industry. Buildings? Yes, buildings! Those that make up our cities and are an essential part of life, providing the places where we live, work, and relax. Our daily bread is to collect and visualize any type of data that is even remotely relevant to real estate - paving the way for much better decision making. No more gut feelings or spreadsheets 🥱

So, in a nutshell, that’s Resights. Or actually not, because what really defines us, are the +40 people behind our software. A collection of nerdy team players who in less than two years have built one of fastest growing startups in Denmark (yes that is true). All while we had fun, because that's truly a part of our DNA 🧬

Engineering at Resights 🤓

Let us take you inside the Engineering team at Resights.

We like to think of ourselves as sympathetic doers. By sympathetic doers, we mean being able to make serious progress super fast without sacrificing being human in the process. We laugh, we have fun, and we know what happens in each others’ lives.

The Engineering team is in close collaboration with our Product team. We actually see the two teams as one big team, sharing goals and responsibility. The Engineering team is 12 people strong, divided almost evenly between frontend and backend. Many different backgrounds, and many different nationalities and cultures. We are a team where all opinions are valued and listened to. Best idea wins, that’s how we like to go about it.

And now we are looking for a Junior Software Engineer to help us grow and ensure our product scales the next 10 years!

About You ⭐️

You’re Swedish speaking student or just graduated, and ready and motivated to learn what it takes to bring Resights solutions to your home-country! You want to work directly with the CTO and Co-Founder of Resights and learn the steps of what it takes to build a comprehensive data solution that aggregates and structures vast amounts of data. You currently have a passion for backend services, but are not hesitant to get your hands dirty in all kinds of areas – and most importantly, passionate about how to go from data to value-creation.

Past experience 🎓

Comfortable with Python programming language.
Native Swedish speaker living in Copenhagen.
Preferably some experience with AWS.
Knowledge of distributed version control, primarily Git.
Preferably some familiarity with SQL or NoSQL databases (Postgres or ElasticSearch).
Strong problem-solving and analytical skills.
Experience in communicating goals, priorities and projects in a comprehensible way.

You love 💙

Being part of a company with a true building culture. Ship fast, learn, ship again.
Striking the balance between speedy and comprehensive solutions, recognizing the appropriate situations for each.
Seeing code as a creative force to solve problems and you enjoy navigating through different potential solutions.
Working in close collaboration with backend, designers and product managers.
Details. Because you know that the devil is in the detail 😈
That the best argument wins, no matter who it comes from.
Learning. Because there is so much we don’t know. And usually a little bit of research gives you a pretty good idea. At least good enough to move the needle.
Asking for forgiveness rather than permission.
Other areas than purely code. You have a natural interest in what is best for the business.

Resights Tech Stack 💾

The frontend stack consists of Vue.js, NuxtJS and Typescript while backend consists of Python leveraging ElasticSearch, Postgres and Redis. Setup deployed in Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS)."
