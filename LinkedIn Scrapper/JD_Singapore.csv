Want to make fun games that give out free money?

We’ve got an opening.

Sqkii is known for our #HuntTheMouse and #HuntFromHome campaigns that give away cold, hard cash to players. In the good old pre-COVID days, our hunts and custom games got Singaporeans squatting in random spots and running after golden eggs. Now, we’re bringing players on a combination of real life adventures and virtual journeys through their mobile screens — they’re still super cool, just ask the mouse.

We paid a virtual visit to the player community in Malaysia at the start of 2021 with #HuntFromHome — Around The World, and oh boy do we have big plans ahead for SEA and beyond. Big plans = bigger team, so we’re on the hunt (ha) for someone who wants to hop onto this thrilling ride.

As our Game Design Intern, you’ll work your magic behind the scenes to bring our current and future games to wild new heights. Fair warning — we’re open to ideas from literally anyone in the team, so you can expect some pretty absurd plans amidst legit game thingamajigs. If you love games, understand games, and can’t wait to create some of the most exciting ones to date, we (and our Game Design team) are 200% ready to meet you.

Our mission is to reinvent the way companies manage their open source information systems - on public clouds and in their own data centres. To achieve that we are building a new community around Python opscode for open source applications, running on Kubernetes. We want to move all of Canonical and Ubuntu IS onto this new, open source codebase.

We are confident that we can dramatically improve the experience of running complex business operations - and then we can help our customers embrace those new techniques and products. Traditionally, IS is an inward-facing operation. We would like to transform our IS team into an extension of the product engineering capability at Canonical.
