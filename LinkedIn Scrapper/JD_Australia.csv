Hours Per Week: 38

Requisition ID: CAM20357

Position Tagline

Tired of big cities? Want to start your days sitting on your deck in the sun, enjoying a cup of coffee and listening to the birds? Or would you rather have a surf or a walk along the sand before work? Then here is your opportunity to work in a busy hospital situated on the lower end of the Gold Coast. Wonderful beaches, world heritage-listed national parks, hinterland villages, great food and fine wine, and excellent public and private schools are all waiting for you in Tweed and the North Coast area.

We will be moving to the new Tweed Valley Hospital (TVH) in early 2024 so here is your opportunity to work in a new hospital with increased services and specialties. This is the largest regional capital health investment funded entirely by the NSW Government.

A great opportunity exists to be part of the new state-of-the-art hospital, with more beds and increased healthcare services. TVH will be a major referral hospital at the heart of the network of hospitals and health facilities across the Tweed Byron region. For more information, please visit https://www.tweedvalleyhospital.health.nsw.gov.au/

TVH Will Include

 more operating theatres and recovery spaces 
 expanded emergency department 
 enhanced medical, surgical and mental health services 
 enhanced ambulatory care services including more outpatient clinics 
 new interventional cardiology service 
 new radiotherapy service as part of a new integrated cancer care service. 

TVH will be a major referral hospital at the heart of the network of hospitals and health facilities across the Tweed-Byron region. It will provide the health services required to meet the needs of the growing population of the region beyond 2032.

The development will provide the community access to more health services closer to home, which will enable patients to remain near family, friends and existing support networks. It?will reduce the need for 5,000?patients to travel outside the region each year to receive treatment.

Where you'll be working

The Tweed Hospital is characterised by friendly relations within the staffing structure and we are a cohesive and happy team, united by our desire to care for others.

What You'll Be Doing

The primary purpose of an Unaccredited Trainee in Emergency Medicine is to provide safe and high quality care, assess and manage, under supervision, patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) and admitted to inpatient wards when rotating to inpatient specialties. The trainee needs to be aware of their limitations and work in a collegiate and collaborate manner.

Decision making and supervision will be at the appropriate level according to the trainee’s skills, knowledge and experience. The Medical Officer will be expected to adopt a progressively more independent approach to patient management according to their experience, under the guidance of and at the discretion of the appropriate Attending Medical Officer (AMO). All patients managed within the hospitals of the health service are under the direct care of a specialist medical practitioner. All decisions regarding their care are to be clearly communicated with the specialist responsible for that care.

The position supports meeting the prerequisites for provisional training with the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM).

Qualifications and experience commensurate with the Essential Requirements for the role (please address these in your response).
Demonstrated ability to work independently in a supervised environment.
Demonstrated ability to work effectively as part of a multi-disciplinary team with an understanding of the roles of the doctor and other members of the healthcare team.

If you enjoy problem solving and analysing, have good admin skills and communicate well, then a career in this rewarding sector will suit you.

Demand for junior business analysts continues to soar as organisations need to evolve and stay competitive in an everchanging world.

We specialise in placing candidates in the business analysis, change management and project management sectors that have qualified through our business analysis study and placement program. Please note we will be looking to place you in an entry level role so this programme is not aimed at existing Business Analysts.

In addition to a new career, you gain a minimum of 4 new internationally recognised qualifications while being fully supported by a team of tutors, mentors, and your own recruitment consultant. The team works with you until you are qualified and placed.

You can also opt to study the BCS International Diploma in Business Analysis to take your studies a step further.
 Once you have passed the 4 required exams you will be handed over to our recruitment team who will provide you with a professional CV and LinkedIn review, interview support, career advice and tailored support like mock interviews.
 Our consultants work with you to identify the best opportunities available suited to you. Their tailored support helps you to prepare for interviews and perform at your best. Typically, you will start in a junior business analyst, junior analyst or a support/admin role in this sector.

Business Analysts work closely with Project Managers and Change Managers and opportunities in these areas also exist which broadens the net in these sister sectors.

To accommodate candidates, the training element of this package is available on finance terms to easily spread the cost of investing in your career. This enables you to get qualified without having to fund all the training costs upfront. In addition, we are so confident in our success with placing qualified candidates that we will refund the cost of the courses to anyone we are unable to place within 12 months of passing their required exams subject to our terms.

Lower GI bleeding is generally managed by the General Surgery team, unless the issue is post-polypectomy bleeding.
